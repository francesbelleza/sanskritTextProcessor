# What's the objective of this prorgam?

   - The objective of this program is to seperate the Devanagari (Sanskrit) and its English
   translation from the text file of a specific work called "The Tantrasara of Abhinavagupta,"
   and then create two seperate text files, one that contains all the Devanagari and then one
   that contains all of the English translation. I've attached the text file of the Tantrasara
   to this repo.

# How to use this program?
   
   - To use this program, you'll need to have the text file in the same src folder as the program,
   enter the name of the text file as it's found in your folder, and then enter two names for extracted
   Sanskrit & English.
