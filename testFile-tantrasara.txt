:Preface
One day in May of 1980 in South Fallsburg, I was sitting in my
room in between programs at the Siddha Yoga Ashram reading
some science fiction book, when Muktananda came in the room.
As always, when Swami Muktananda came in the room, every-
body's foreheads immediately hit the floor, and that day was no
exception. Mine was on the floor immediately. The first thing
Muktananda did in looking around the room while I was on the
floor was to note there was a book on the bed. He asked me what
it was. I told him, and he said, "Don't read that; read Kashmir
Śaivism." And that began my decades-long interest in the study of
what is now called Śakta-Śaivism.
One of the great deficiencies that those of us who have an inter-
est in Śaivism have suffered under is the absence of qualified
scholars who are willing to engage in translation projects. The
Buddhists are fortunate enough to have living traditions-esoteric
Śaivism lost its last living lineage holder with the passing of
Swami Lakshman Joo-and a great deal of reserve of both cultural
and financial capital in the organizations that promote Vajrayana
Buddhism, and none of this has existed in support of those of us
who have great interest in esoteric Śaivism. Because of that, I have
caused many different works to become translated.
This particular project has been going on so long, I can't even
remember when it started. After Swami Muktananda passed away,
I began visiting Swami Lakshman Joo in Srinagar. I was never
really able to stay there long enough to really study with him or to
consider myself a student of his, but I was and am a great admirer
viiVIII PREFACE
of him. His blending of intellectual development and a uniquely
human quality of compassion was really extraordinary, and he was
an extremely beautiful person. Sometime in the early 1990s, how-
ever, it became too difficult to go to Kashmir, because of the poli-
tics of the place. Still intent on continuing my reading and study
of Kashmir Śaivism, and having met all the Kashmiri pandits, I
went to Benares to meet Pandit H.N. Chakravarty. In doing so, I
also met many of the people associated with him in Benares, such
as Bettina Bäumer and Pandit Kamalakar Mishra, whose work on
Kashmir Śaivism I published more than a decade ago. At the time
I met Pandit Chakravarty, I requested him to translate the Tan-
trasāra into English, and he agreed. And so we launched on the:
- project, and it was a couple of years later that he delivered å manu-
script which, in fact, was absolutely unreadable. While his knowl-
edge of Śaivism was deep, his English was extremely limited, and
there was really nothing I could do about the publication of the
manuscript; it was just impossible. So it languished for years, until
there was pressure from Chakravarty's side and from some of his
friends in Canada for us to do something about the manuscript.
What eventually came about was that Boris Marjanovic took on
the project, and it was really his effort to bring a readable English
translation of the Tantrasāra out that has given renewed life to this
project and ultimately brought it to the extremely fine state that it
is in.
:
Boris Marjanovic deserves an enormous amount of credit for
the existence of this manuscript in the quality that it is. I am grate-
ful to Pandit H.N. Chakravarty and to all of his friends, including
Bettina Bäumer, for her support, and I am especially grateful to
Boris Marjanovic.

Tantrasāra (TS), as its name suggests, is the summary of impor-
tant notions, principles, doctrines, and practices found in the Tan-
tras in general and in the Tantrāloka (TA) in particular. The TA is
Abhinavagupta's most extensive work on the principles of nondual
Śaiva doctrines written in verse, while the TS, which is its sum-
mary, is significantly shorter and written in prose.
It was the tradition of some of the ancient pandits belonging
to different schools of Indian thought to write brief and simpli-
fied versions of the main principles and doctrines of their schools.
The purpose of this practice was to provide those interested in the
subject but unable to devote years of study to Sanskrit grammar
and logic, deemed prerequisites for the study of any other branch
of learning, with a simplified and comprehensible overview of the
main principles of their respective schools. Abhinavagupta and
his disciple Kşemarāja wholeheartedly embraced this practice. As
early as the second benedictory verse of the TS, Abhinavagupta
declares the complexity, vastness, and depth of the topics dis-
cussed in the TĀ as the main reason for writing its short version.
The primary aim of the TS is to make knowledge easily acces-
sible; thus, Abhinavagupta avoids getting into complex and lengthy
philosophical arguments and elaboration, and lays out the subject
matter smoothly and concisely. For us, on the other hand, who
are attempting to study and to understand this text a millennium
later, the brevity of the style of the TS presents a significant chal-
lenge. Furthermore, the Sanskrit used by Abhinavagupta in the TS
is not easy, and the notions and practices found in it are obscure
ixX FOREWORD
and sometimes incomprehensible. It is because of these difficulties
that this text remains inaccessible not only to the general public
but also to Sanskrit scholars and Indologists whose specialty is
outside of Tantric studies. However, it should be pointed out here
that a reader at the time of Abhinavagupta would have experi-
enced significantly less difficulty in understanding this text than
we are experiencing today, especially when it comes to ritual prac-
tices and observances. The reason for this is that the tradition was
alive and its teaching and practices were widespread and therefore
understandable to those interested in learning them.
For example, in Chapter Sixteen, Abhinavagupta speaks of
the application of the net (jalaprayoga), the procedure by which
the initiator catches the departed souls during the ritual of ini-
tiation. There he explains that these departed souls, for one rea-
son or another, hadn't received initiation before their death but
deserved to be initiated because of their service to the teacher
or some other devout activity. It is the command of Śiva, Abhi-
navagupta further clarifies, that the teacher, through the applica-
tion of the net, should bring a departed soul to enter the figure
of ku, a grass that represents a departed devotee, and then per-
form the initiation procedure. This knowledge, according to Abhi-
navagupta's own admission, was transmitted to him orally by his
teacher Śambhunatha. It is difficult to fully comprehend from the
available sources what the nature, method, and application of this
practice were. It seems clear, however, that the power of the deep
meditation of the teacher was believed to be the deciding factor for
the success of the entire process.
As already pointed out, the brevity of the style of the TS pre-
sents a serious difficulty in understanding this text. Fortunately,
these doctrines are often discussed at length by the same author
in his TĀ as well as in his other works. The translator then is
required to read the TA along with the TS if intent on grasping
the meaning and wider context of topics discussed. Thus, the TA
and the TS complement each other, although on rare occasions the
translator is fortunate to find additional information or explana-FOREWORD XI
tions in the TS itself that were left out and not elaborated on in the
TĀ. This conforms to the style of Abhinavagupa that he adopted
from his teacher Śambhunatha, which was not to keep knowledge
completely hidden but also not to reveal it all at one place or in a
single book. This, of course, is meant to provide necessary prac-
tice for students as well as to test their devotion to knowledge.
Finally, Abhinavagupta refers to a number of Tantric and other
texts that are now lost to us, including the Bhairavakulormi Tan-
tra, Nityā Tantra, Parameśvarānuttara Tantra, Tantrasadbhāva
Tantra, Yogasamcāra, and other texts which have clearly influ-
enced his thought. Fortunately, in recent years some of these texts;
such as Tantrasadbhāva Tantra,were edited and made available to
scholars.
My association with Pandit Chakravarty goes back to 1997. At
that time I lived in Varanasi with the intention of reading Sanskrit
texts with Prof. Shri Narayana Mishra. Shri Narayana Mishra was
the first and the most important of my teachers during the time I
worked on my Ph.D. thesis and other projects. It is because of his
selfless teaching style that I learned how to read and understand
śāstric texts.
As I was primarily interested in Kashmiri Śaiva philosophy
and practices, I began to visit the home of Pandit Chakravarty, a
renowned Tantric scholar with profound understanding of Kash-
miri Śaivism. His recognition as a scholar was derived from his
lifelong study of Sanskrit and its philosophy, but more than that,
his recognition came from his close association with Mahamaho-
padhyaya Gopinath Kaviraj. During one of many conversations
that we had, I found out that in addition to already publishing his
translation of the TS in Hindi, he had also completed the Eng-
lish translation of the same text. Furthermore, he told me that he
had submitted the manuscript for publication to Rudra Press many
years ago. However, for reasons unknown to him, the publication
of his work had never taken place. It was only several years later
when I met Sharon Ward, the head of Rudra Press at that time,
that I learned the reason: She explained to me that they felt thatXII TANTRASĀRA
the translation was in need of a good editor, which, because of the
complexity of the text, they were unable to provide. It was then
that she suggested that I work together with Pandit Chakravarty
and help him put the translation of the TS into English that would
be understandable to a wider audience.
When we began to work together in the summer of 2004, I soon
discovered that the problem with Pandit Chakravarty's English
translation was not the lack of knowledge of the English language
on his part but his desire and insistence on literal translations.
Thus, his English translation preserved the syntax of Sanskrit sen-
tences, which, combined with the obscurity of the text, resulted
in English sentences that were incomprehensible. We spent the
next two years going carefülly through the text sentence by sen-
tence. In addition to helping him to express the Sanskrit text in
simple and easily understandable English sentences I have written
explanatory note for Chapters Twelve through Twenty-Two as well
as several notes for Chapter Nine.
Generally speaking, the problem with reading translations of
Sanskrit philosophical texts is that a reader is usually unfamil-
iar with the style and technical terminology used by the ancient
Sanskrit authors. Sanskrit philosophical literature is specialized
literature, the understanding of which requires training. Thus, the
readers of this translation might find it difficult to grasp the mean-
ing of some parts of this text. In order to overcome this problem,
Pandit Chakravarty conveniently summarized each chapter of TS
and included it in his Introduction. I strongly recommend that any-
one who makes the effort to study this text in depth first carefully
read his Introduction.

Chapter One
The Tantrasara begins by stating that perfect knowledge (pūrṇa-
prathā) is the cause of liberation. It is the revelation of Śiva-nature
in one's own Self. Șiva, who by His power of freedom (svatantrya
śakti) appears to be limited in knowledge and action, removes all
veils by the same power. As a result of this, He shines in His pris-
tine, self-refulgent, pure consciousness. On the dawn of supreme
knowledge of the nature of light (prakāśa), marked by reflective
self-knowledge (vimarśa), everything shines nondifferently in the
mirror of consciousness. While describing the nature of mokșa,
Abhinavagupta writes in the Paramartha-sāra that there is no
separate region of it, nor is one to proceed toward it, but it is to
be realized by piercing the knots of ignorance by virtue of the
full development of one's own power of freedom. However, mokșa
should not be taken as the effect of knowledge (jñāna) and the lat-
ter the cause of it, but as the manifestation of the real nature of the
Self (ātman).
According to this Śavādvaya system, ignorance is accepted as
the cause of saṁsāra, yet the nature of ajñāna is known as āņava
mala, a limitation innate in the individual. It originates from the
absolute freedom of the Lord. The āņavamala operates in the indi-
vidual soul in two ways: (i) the loss to consciousness of its free-
dom, and (ii) the sense of agency without bodha. This limitation of
jñāna and kriyā is known as spiritual (pauruşa) and intellectual/
scriptural (bauddha) ignorance (ajñāna).
Ignorance, known as bauddha ajñāna, is of the nature of inde-
termination (aniścayasvabhāvam) and determination of contradic-
12 TANTRASĀRA
tory nature (viparītaniścaya). Because of the presence of the first,
the individual soul in bondage fails to definitely know the real
nature of the Self, and because of the second one, experiences
and feels himself to be the experiencing subject of what is really
non-self, such as: body, intellect, prāņa, etc. Pauruşa ajñāna,
characterized by limited knowledge brought into existence by
āņavamala, is considered by Abhinavagupta and his tradition to
be the cause of worldly existence.
Paurușa ajñāna can be removed by initiation (dīkṣā), but a
person cannot avail himself of it while the impurity known as
bauddha ajñāna lying in his intellect remains. This is because
initiation is necessarily preceded by the firm conviction regard-
ing right knowledge of the things to be avoided, and right knowl-
edge of the things to be accepted (heyopadeyaniścaya). Right
knowledge can only be obtained from the sacred literature (śāstra)
taught by Parameśvara. He is the highest authority and origin of
all sacred literatures. These revealed texts are the givers of release
to the souls in bondage. The number of the revealed texts known
as āgamas are ten, eighteen, and sixty-four. For Abhinavagupta,
the essence of them is the Trika system, and the most important of
them is the Maālinīvijaya Tantra.
Abhinavagupta writes that he will give an exposition of the
Mālinīvijaya, for he argues that unless the real nature of things
is determined, one will be unable to attain liberation. It is pure
knowledge alone that possesses the quality of bestowing release.
The highest principle, which is of the nature of light, is Śiva.
He, the most desirable of all, is one's own unique nature (sva-
bhāva). Light (prakāśa) is pure consciousness, which is the very
life of everything; though shining in all, it shines as blue and jar
distinctly, separate from each other. This notion of separateness,
the knowledge of duality, is considered to be ajñāna, but pure
consciousness (caitanya) is really knowledge (jñāna). It is uni-
versal (sarvasāmānya). It is present everywhere, and possesses
absolute freedom of wisdom and activity (jñānakriyāvān). The
non-shining of this universal light to the person who is limited is
the primary ignorance of the Self.INTRODUCTION 3
The light of which we have spoken above is independent. Its
independence means that it depends on nothing. It is all-encom-
passing, eternal, has the nature of assuming all forms, and at the
same time it is without any form (sarvākaranirakāra svābhāva).
Its absolute freedom is the "power of bliss" (ānanda śakti), the
relish of one's own bliss (ānanda) is icchā śakti, its self-reflective
light is jñānaśakti, its unifying relation with all is kriyāśakti.
Śiva, though associated with all His principal śaktis, always
remains free from limitations and rests in His blissful nature.
When, by His absolute freedom of will, He manifests Himself as
limited, He is then known as the bonded soul or limited know-
ing subject (aņu). Then, as a result of self-recognition, He again
shines as Śiva, marked by absolute freedom and unlimited light.
By virtue of His absolute freedom, He either shines without any
means (anupāya) or sometimes with means (upāya). These upāyas,
the ways of absorption of the individual consciousness into the
divine, may be of the nature of icchā, jñāna, or kriyā. These
icchā, jñāna, and kriyā are the śaktis of Śiva. When a yogin
is able to grasp any of them, it becomes easy for him to attain
Śiva. As the means (upāya) are three, so the forms of absorption
(samāveśa) are also three; hence they are known as śāmbhava,
śākta, and āņava samāveśas.
This, in short, is the summary of the first chapter of the Tan-
trasāra.
Chapter Two
The second chapter begins with a brief presentation of anupāya.
Anupāya is not counted under any upāya on account of its subtlety,
and even more, because the person on whom the most intense
descent of grace (śaktipāta) has fallen does not have any need for
internal or external help in order to realize his identity with Śiva.
The word of the teacher, heard only once, places him on the tran-
scendent path (anuttarapatha), the stable ground of the blissful
nature of Śakti, upon which he at once realizes the self-manifest
Lord as his own very Self.4 TANTRASĀRA
Śiva is eternal; therefore there is no possibility of realizing
Him by any means (upāya). As He is self-manifest, the means can-
not add anything to Him. If it is said that some means would assist
in the removal of the veils, then this is untenable, for there is no
ultimate existence of any of the veils. In the same way, the ques-
tion of the merger of the one into the other cannot stand, for there
is the total absence of two separate entities. This chain of reason-
able arguments causes a firm conviction to manifest in the aspi-
rant. As a result of this conviction, he realizes that the Absolute,
the mass of bliss, is the single Truth, and that Śiva is the universal
"I am He" in whom everything shines inseparably in the mirror of
consciousness. Thus, when firmly contemplated, he finds himself
in absorption, in oneness, with the divine.
In the Tantraloka, Jayaratha comments that in the sambhava,
śākta, and āņava upāyas, there is a possibility that duality may
arise because of the functioning of icchā, jñāna, and kriyā śaktis;
for example, icchā becomes externally inclined because of the
presence of something desirable (eșanīya) in the core of icchā. On
the other hand, in anupāya, because of the functioning of ananda
śakti, which is said to be Brahman Himself, there is not even a tint
of an upaya existing as separate from it.
Chapter Three
The ātman has the characteristics of light and freedom, and is free
from all thought constructs (vikalpa). It is Śiva, the absolute. It
is without parts, the integral whole of infinite light that encom-
passes everything-the single realm of light where thought does
not reach (nirvikalpaikadhāman). Although an ordinary soul, in its
contracted state as a result of the influence of the three impurities
(malas), is not different from that light, it is unable to conceive this,
and fails to realize its identity with that light. As soon as grace
descends on it, even a little, he begins to realize the truth, and by a
sudden flash, he is able to perceive that light without the interven-
tion of any upāya. This perception is direct and immediate.INTRODUCTION 5
In this perception of light there is no separate entity to be
reflected upon. It is of the nature of self-reflection and has the
characteristic of vibration. Here the yogin resorts to icchā śakti as
a means for realizing his identity with that light.
The absolute freedom of the Lord (svatantrya śakti), men-
tioned above, causes the images of entities (bhāvas) to manifest in
the clear mirror of pure consciousness. The bhāvas cannot shine
by themselves; they shine in the void of consciousness as reflec-
tions. For this reason, the Lord is said to be immanent. As this
śakti is sentient, not inert, so too is its amarśa or cognition; that is,
her self-reflection continues ceaselessly.. Her self-reflective nature
is known as parānāda, which in the āgama literature is repre-
sented as a goddess called parāvāk, the Supreme Sound.
Speech (vāk) is śakti and is not different from reflective aware-
ness (vimarśa). The śaktis which extend and assume the form of
the universe are chiefly three: anuttara, icchā, and unmeșa. Basi-
cally, they are nothing but the nature of reflection (parāmarśa),
assuming the syllabic form of the letters, such as: "a," "i," "u." It
is from them that all the sāktis originate. The fifty syllables of
the Sanskrit alphabet come broadly under two groups: the sixteen
letters from a to visarga are known as vowels, and the rest, from
ka to ha, are consonants. The vowels are the seeds (bījas) and the
consonants are the receptacles (yonis) for receiving the seeds.
Primarily, the Lord who is anuttara becomes ānanda, which
is the self-reflection of universal consciousness (cit). As cit in
its slight vibration becomes intent on externality, it is known as
ānanda. Similarly, icchā becomes īśana when it rests in icchā. In
the same way, urmi is the reflective unmeșa. As syllables, these
three are indicated by "a," "i," "u." From u onward, kriyā śakti
begins to function. The former three parāmarśas have the charac-
teristics of prakāśa. Hence, they are of the nature of the sun, and
the latter parāmarśas, the long vowels "ā," "i," "ū,” are of the
nature of soma or moon, with the characteristic of rest.
When icchā and īśana become inclined toward activity, or, in
other words, when activity enters them, disturbance sets in, which6 TANTRASĀRA
66
causes a break within that tranquility. Then icchā and īśana are
known as işyamāņa. In one, the light is predominant, while the
other is of the nature of rest. They are known as "r," "r," "l,"
"!." They are the only semivowels, and are unlike the consonant
sounds of ra and la; therefore they are not considered consonants
as such. Since they retain both the vowel and consonant sounds,
they are considered to be neuter.
The creative movement which proceeds to flow from anuttara
gives rise to different syllables. The impelling force of kriyā śakti
terminates after giving rise to the varņas like "e," "ai," "o," and
"au." After that, the inward movement begins to operate. As a
result of this, the resultants are then put to rest in anuttara. It is to
be noted here that this anuttara is different from anuttara known
as akāra, the supreme Bhairava. It manifests as am, which is pure
consciousness in essence. From that anuttara, visarga unfolds.
Visarga, better known as visarga śakti, is the creative force
which manifests herself as the universe. She remains inseparably
united with the Absolute before the rise of agitation in it. The uni-
verse as we see it is the manifestation of light as indicated objects
(vācya), and in turn, the reflection of that light stands for each
of the indicative sounds as represented by "a," "ā," "i," etc. The
manifestation that occurs in this twofold way (vācya and vācaka)
is, in reality, the manifestation of vāk, the supreme speech. The
supreme, known as akula, is possessed of power (sakti) which
gives rise to the universe. This power is called kaulikī śakti. She
retains the universe within herself in a very subtle form, but
because of the creative impulse expands herself in three stages.
These stages of creation are internal but are projected externally
by the Lord by means of His visarga śakti. Creation, as known to
us, is predominantly of the nature of difference or duality (bheda);
this is the gross form of creation. In the language of the āga-
mas, it is known as āņava visarga, creation on the objective level.
The creation in which difference and nondifference (bhedābheda)
shine is called śākta visarga; this is the subtle form of creation.
• The creation of nondual nature is known as śāmbhava visarga, the
subtlest of all creations.INTRODUCTION 7
Anava visarga shines externally in a gross form. The entire
creation consists of the instrument of knowledge and the object
of knowledge (pramāņa and prameya), and knowledge with its
limited nature shines as mutually different and also different from
the Self. In sākta visarga, however, the universe shines in a dual-
nondual relation. In āņava visarga, difference is predominant. It
is of the characteristic of ha, while in śākta visarga, all that is
experienced (seen, heard, touched, etc.) by the self is obliterated.
The universe becomes perfectly intent on pure consciousness. It is
the awakening of citta toward cit. Citta, though cit by nature, in
its empirical consciousness becomes the experiencing subject, and
in its view all objects shine as different from it. This occurs due
to the subject-object relationship. Because of this relationship, the
universe shines with a variety of objects. At this stage, cit, the
experiencing subject of the world-picture, descends down to the
level of citta by imposing upon itself the limitations of objects.
In śākta visarga, citta is not shining as the subject and its
objects with their mutual differences, but rather, it is shining as
one with consciousness. In the former case, the resting and ter-
minating of citta is in objects having limitations, while here it
is submerging all sorts of limitations into all-inclusive pure con-
sciousness. For this reason, it is known as citta sambodha, the
awakening of citta; that is, in this stage, citta becomes intent on
offering itself in the partless nature of Śiva, who is characterized
as integral Light.
In śāmbhava visarga, however, there shines neither difference
nor non-difference; even the universe is absent there; moreover,
not even the slightest trace of citta is perceptible. It shines as uni-
versal consciousness (cit), free from all limitations, and remains
completely refulgent in its perfection. This is the highest visarga,
characterized by ānanda.
The person who has realized his identity with that light experi-
ences that everything from the earth to Śiva shines in the mirror
of consciousness. The very nature of śāmbhavopāya is this kind
of comprehension. Abhinavagupta has presented this idea in the
Tantrāloka in this way: Bhairava, the clear void of consciousness,8 TANTRASĀRA
creates the picture of the universe in Himself. He manifests it and
experiences: "I am the universe." Thus, He assumes an immanent
nature; this is His function of creation. Then, He maintains the
six-fold paths and experiences them as being reflected in Himself.
Thus, He is the one who manifests maintenance. Lastly, the entire
universe is withdrawn and dissolved into the flame of all-consum-
ing fire; this is His function of dissolution.
The person who is able to realize the partless one as the
single, integral unity of consciousness in which these three
functions-creation, maintenance, and dissolution-have their rise
and rest, is absorbed in the supreme by means of śāmbhavopāya.
Chapter Four
The highest end for human beings is to attain the very nature of
Parāmaśiva, who is ever free from determinacy or "thought con-
structs" (vikalpa). One is able to rid oneself of thought constructs
by means of pure reasoning (sattarka), by listening to holy texts
known as āgamas, and by following the teachings of a spiritual
teacher. The practice of contemplating or viewing everything as
the essential reality (Śiva) is the means by which one is able to rise
above impure thought constructs (aśuddha-vikalpas). The Tan-
trasāra states that one considers oneself bound because of vikal-
pas. The wrong conception of one's true nature as body, etc., is
the cause of mundane existence; however, when a vikalpa of the
opposite nature pure "thought construct" (suddha-vikalpa) is born,
it dispels the wrong kind of thought construct, places one on the
right path, and enables one to attain the highest good.
Though pure thought constructs are of no avail in revealing the
nature of Paramaśiva, the supreme reality, for it is everywhere
and in every way ever luminous, it is the considered opinion of
the author that pure vikalpas remove the sense of duality from the
Self. The sense of duality is not something positive, but is only
ignorance (akhyāti) of one's essential nature. This sense of duality
is removed by pure thought constructs (suddha-vikalpa).
Pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā) leads to sattarka, or pure rea-
:INTRODUCTION 9
soning. One should bear in mind that sattarka is distinct from the
form of gross reasoning as understood in the Nyaya system, for
it is said that sattarka arises by itself in a person whom sakti has
keenly touched. This tarka leads to the continuity of ideas similar
to śuddha-vikalpa. It is stated in the Tantrasāra: The supreme
reality is unlimited by nature and consists of an undivided singu-
larity of consciousness. It transcends all the principles of limited
nature which terminate in Śiva. This renders stability to all and is
the vitality of universe. Through it the universe "throbs” with life,
and that is "I" (aham).
The continuous practice of sattarka regarding the nature of
reality brings about the purity of "thought constructs." The high-
est excellence of sattarka terminates in bhāvanā, by which one is
able to make manifest as distinct even the most indistinct.
In some, sattarka may arise by itself, without the need for
recourse to any spiritual guide or the reading of holy texts. When
it is enlivened in a person, he is considered to have been initiated
by the luminous goddesses of his own consciousness (samviddevis),
the deities personifying consciousness itself.
However, the person on whom the grace of the Lord has
descended less keenly should be initiated by the spiritual teacher,
after which he is able to secure the right of listening to āgamas,
which by their proper understanding help one to become free from
doubts. Afterwards, the truth that is contained in the āgama gives
rise to sattarka in him.
Sattarka is the light of "pure knowledge" (śuddhavidyā). It is
considered to be the most excellent and direct limb of yoga. It is
stated in the Tantrasāra that yoga is also a kind of vikalpa, but
that it is characterized by intensive awareness (anusandhānātmā)
regarding essential reality. For the purpose of keeping the essen-
tial reality ever luminous in his view, the yogin takes recourse to
this form of vikalpa for the maturity of his awareness.
Parameśvara is by nature pure consciousness and is ever full.
His fullness is His Śakti, the Divine I-consciousness. By the grace
of śuddhavidyā, one has recourse to cit śakti, which finally leads
the aspirant to Śāmbhu, the Lord.10 TANTRASĀRA
Chapter Five
When a thought construct (vikalpa) cannot become pure by itself,
and one has to depend on other means for its purification, the
aspirant is decidedly staying in the lower stage of spiritual devel-
opment; in other words, in him śaktipāta has occurred to a lesser
degree. Therefore, for the purification of vikalpas, and because he
is limited himself, he resorts to means that are also limited. Hence,
the individual takes up practices of the intellect (buddhi), vital
energy (prāņa), or the body itself for this purpose.
Among these kinds of aspirants, those more advanced proceed
on the path of meditation (dhyāna). The Tantrasāra gives a brief
account of how this contemplative meditation is to be performed.
Though it is called dhyāna, it is quite distinct from the dhyānaš
found in various holy texts, especially those in which the aspirant
imagines his desired deity as having a face and limbs.
The Tantrasāra describes dhyāna in the following manner: In
the core of his conscious heart, the aspirant meditates upon the
self-luminous essential reality, which abides in all. This medita-
tion is to be performed in such a way that the three-namely, the
subject, the instrument of knowledge, and the object, representing
fire, the sun, and the moon, respectively-have coalesced together
and become the unity of a single mass of consciousness. This med-
itation is to be continued as long as they have their separate iden-
tities, until they shine as one light and blaze up as the fire of the
great Lord. This fire is to be meditated upon as surrounded by
twelve Kālīs. These Kālīs are none but the flames of the wheel of
fire. This fire should be thought of as emitting rays through out-
lets such as the eyes, which take their rest on the object of external
senses. The object is to be thought of as being nourished by the
creative energy of the moon, then it is maintained and made mani-
fest by the sun, and finally it is dissolved by the energy of fire so
that it may be drawn inside and made transcendent (anuttara).
When this type of dhyāna is continuously performed, the aspi-
rant quickly realizes that every object and idea is nothing but the
essence of pure consciousness. He further realizes that creation
and other functions are essentially the play of the Lord.
:INTRODUCTION 11
After dhyāna, the text gives a description of uccāra. The
upward movement of prāņa is commonly known as uccāra; how-
ever, uccāra has the characteristics of spanda, which is the very
soul of it.
Prāņa is of two kinds, one general (sāmānya) and the other
specific (viśeṣa). In the former, difference of any sort is totally
absent, while in the latter, because of distinct activities, the same
prāņa shows itself in five forms, known as prāņa, apāna, samāna,
udāna, and vyāna. It is quite evident that these five have their
base in the general prāņa.
Because of the vibrating movement of prāņa, inarticulate
sound, known as the "unstruck" sound (anāhatanāda), becomes-
manifest. It sounds continuously, without any break, in the heart
of every living being. This nāda is associated with two bījas,
namely srștibīja (sa) and samhārabīja (ha).
The activity of prāņa functions without any conscious effort on
the part of the living being. Usually prāņa moves along the chan-
nels of ida and pingala. The middle path remains blocked for the
ordinary human being. When, by the grace of the spiritual teacher,
the middle path opens up, then the aspirant's journey toward the
supreme begins.
The aspirant realizes that the movement of prāņa is associated
with Śakti. It is she who, in the form of hamsa, is moving forward
and is the real mover of prāņa. At that time, the aspirant realizes
that she gets the two bijas nourished in the two places of their
origin, namely, the heart (hrdaya) and dvādaśānta, the top of the
head. Upon this realization, the yogin feels that the prāņa, before
its rise, takes rest in the void of the heart; then, by its externaliza-
tion as apāna, the external objects not only shine forth but also get
nourished by apāna, the moon. The yogin then experiences the
all-pervasive nature of prāņa. On account of specific activities of
prāņa in various parts of the body, the yogin experiences various
kinds of delights according to his aptitude in causing the prāņa to
rest in these spots. These delights (ānanda) are named nirānanda
and others. They are six in number.
By the experience of these delights in different parts of the
:12 TANTRASĀRA
body, he finally realizes that the highest place of rest is some-
where other than the body and prāņa. Ultimately, he realizes the
highest form of delight, known as universal bliss (jagadānanda),
in which there is no limitation, for it shines in all directions and
where ever-shining consciousness alone remains. It expresses
itself as the knower, the means of knowledge, and the known
objects. It expands by the nectar of the divine joy of absolute sov-
ereignty, in which there is no need for contemplation.
It should be noted here also that prāņa and apāna are two fac-
tors which perform the functions of dissolution and creation, while
samāna balances the two pulls of energy in the inner vișuvat, the
void. Then udāna, the upper current, begins to flow along the
middle path. Finally, the vital energy becomes vyāna, the all-
pervading one in which all limitations have their end.
The yogin, by means of his close observation of two bījas
mentioned above, should make his vikalpas free from impurities.
Then, according to his proficiency of entering the place of rest :
in different parts of the body (viśrānti), he first experiences the
delights (ānandas) mentioned above, followed by udbhava, kampa,
nidrāi, and ghürni. The bodily centers where they are experienced
are known as mūlādhāra, kanda, hṛdaya, telu, and dvādaśānta.
Dvādaśānta, which is known also as urdhvakundalini, is the place
where the difference of Śakti and Śiva ends. It is of the character-
istic of "vibration of consciousness" (samvitspanda).
The inarticulate sound (anahātanāda) is ever present, but it
becomes manifest by the rhythmic movement of prāņa, which gives
rise to varņa, or syllabic sound. It should be borne in mind that
this nāda is not properly called varņa, as it is the cause of syllables.
Seed mantras (bījas) known as srști and samhāra (sa and ha) are the
two chief syllables in association with which anahātanāda becomes
manifest. Therefore, the yogin tries to fix his mind in them so that
he may get the touch of nada. He practices hearing the nāda by
uttering different syllables either ending in a vowel or not ending in
any vowel, for he knows that nāda abides in all the varņas, latent
in an undivided form. Even by calling to mind the ever-sounding
nāda he experiences identity with pure consciousness.INTRODUCTION 13
Chapter Six
Chapter Six describes the method for the realization of essen-
tial reality by external means. In the preceding chapter, Abhi-
navagupta describes āņavopāya, which helps the aspirant attain
absorption into the divine Self through the means of uccāra,
dhyāna, varņa, and karaņa. The present section discusses how
a yogin adopts prāṇavāyu as the means for attaining his or her
desired goal.
From this chapter onward, whatever is described up to Chap-
ter Twelve comes under the "formation of the place" (sthānapra-
kalpana). The locations are three: the vital energy, the body, and
other external objects.
The six paths (adhvas) are immense. They have their base in
general prāņa, while the adhva known as time (kāla) has its base
in a specific prāņa.
The objects shine in two ways, either with sequence or with-
out any sequence. The act of confining anything within limits
(kalana) is the function of time (kāla). Although pure conscious-
ness is free from all limiting adjuncts, the universe in the form
of the knower and the known is made manifest by its freedom of
will. As a result, they shine forth with their distinctive and limited
character. The agency of the delimiting power of consciousness is
known as kāla śakti, which is power in the form of time. However,
before the apparent externalization of objects, sequence and non-
sequence remain latent in its pure nature. The entire universe not
only remains inseparably one with the light (prakāśa), but in order
to show itself as limited, prakāśa at first negates the universe
and experiences "I am transcending the universe." Thus, the void
(śūnya) transcending everything is known as śūnya pramātā, the
knowing subject of the void.
Because of its association with impurity (āņava mala), the
knowing subject of the void (śūnya pramātā) becomes externally
inclined, and the universe that was previously rejected or negated
is now thought of as the most desirable object. Then a vibrating
upsurge occurs in it, which shows itself as prāņa.14 TANTRASĀRA
Prāņa is the first expansion of consciousness. It shows itself as
spanda, the very nature of self-reflection. For this reason, prāņa
is said to be predominantly of the nature of the power of activity
(kriyā śakti). Therefore, though it is inert (jada), it is primarily of
the nature of consciousness. For this reason, by resorting to prāņa,
the aspirant is able to attain the supreme reality.
Prāņa is the very life of every living being. It is always on the
move. Because of its activities in different locations of the body,
the universal prāņa is known as prāņa, apāna, samāna, udāna,
and vyāna. Of these five, prāņa and apāna function as the activity
of inhaling and exhaling. The incoming movement of the breath
starts from the heart and ends "twelve fingers above one's head,"
known as dvādaśānta, while the outgoing movement of the breath
starts from dvādaśānta and ends at the heart. This movement con-
tinues and goes on functioning 21,600 times in a single day.
Prāņa is the manifest form of sakti, and all the six adhvas
-namely, varņa, mantra, and pada on the one hand, and kalā, tat-
tva, and bhūvana on the other-have their respective locations in
it. It is to be noted here that adhvas are generally known as paths
which lead the aspirant in a sequence to the supreme. In the end,
however, for the one in whom the right view of nonduality has
developed, these adhvas become absorbed in I-consciousness. For
this reason, adhvas are not simply paths but are also something
that is absorbed.
Hence the yogin makes an effort to realize the supreme real-
ity by resorting to prāņa, and thus puts an end to the mutations
caused by the impelling force of time.
By its nature prāņa is constantly vibrating. This vibration
arises spontaneously in the location of kanda (bulb) below the
generative organ. The spontaneous movement of prāņa bestows
little spiritual result in comparison with the movement of the vital
energy that is caused by the conscious effort of the yogin. Hence,
by his deliberate effort in association with jyeștha śakti, the yogin
tries to impel his prāņa from the center of the heart along the
path upward so that it may reach the dvādaśānţa, twelve fingersINTRODUCTION 15
above one's head. After letting it rest there, it is made to move
again toward the heart. This ingoing and outgoing process is sim-
ply known as inhaling and exhaling, but to the yogin it means
something else. In the primary stage, the yogin with keen observa-
tion watches each movement of prāņa rising in the heart, proceed-
ing upward and coming back into the heart again. He divides the
whole course of prāņa into sixteen divisions. Each of these sixteen
divisions is known as tuți, representing a day. Similarly, the exha-
lation represents a night. When the yogin becomes sufficiently
proficient, he then takes each movement of prāņa and apāna to
represent a month.
The course along which prāņa and apana move measures
thirty-six digits (anguli). The yogin assumes that the hour, the
tithi, and other long and short units of time get their rise in prāņa.
It should be noted here that kriyā śakti, which operates externally
as kāla śakti in prāņa, is without any definite form. For this rea-
son, whatever shines in prāņa as measures of very small amounts
of time, such as kșana, lava, and so forth, may shine as a year or
more than several years. Not only do they shine and rise in it, but
they also terminate in the highest equilibrium.
When prāņa runs the course of two and one-quarter digits, the
duration is known as a tuți. Four of such tutis make a prahara,
while half of a tuți is known as gap (sandhyā). The exhaling and
the inhaling represent the day and the night.
In the same way, the yogin also conceives that a month, consist-
ing of thirty lunar days (tithis) with broad divisions of two fort-
nights, rises in prāņa. All the tithis from the first day of the lunar
fortnight (pratipad) to the night of new moon (amāvāsya), and
then again from pratipad to the full moon day (pūrņimā), lie along
the course of the inhaling and exhaling movement of prāņa and
apāna. The sixteenth tithi, consisting of half a tuți at the start and
another half at the final resting place, is considered to be the san-
dhyā, the meeting point of the day and the night. These two halves
of tutis are free from the influence of time, and for this reason
sandhyās are considered to be very auspicious. Similarly, during
:16 TANTRASĀRA
the dark fortnight, the moon or the apāna offers its digits (kalā)
one by one to prāņa, the sun, and the final one is offered near
the dvādaśānta at the fifteenth tuti, after which the moon itself
gets dissolved into the sun. This is known as amāvāsya, when the
moon remains latent in the kalā known as ama. When the span of
one half of the tuți occupied by amāvāsya gets into the portion of
pratipad, the duration of the tithi is cut short and therefore a solar
eclipse occurs. The eclipse obliterates the difference of the know-
ing subject (pramātā), the instrument of knowledge (pramāņa),
and the objects known (prameya). Therefore, the occasion is con-
sidered to be auspicious because it bestows otherworldly results.
Similarly, a year is supposed to get its rise in a single move-
ment of prāņa. For this reason, the entire course of the movement
of prāņa and apāna corresponds with uttarāyaņa (the progress
of the sun to the north) and daksināyaņa (the progress of the sun
to the south). In this case, the tithis occupy only one-fifth of a
digit and the "sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac (rāśi) tọ
another" (samkrānti) occurs every six digits.
For the purpose of minimizing the influence of time, the yogin
further strives to get twelve years to rise in a single movement of
prāņa and apāna. He locates sixty tithis in a digit, and the passage
of one rāśi to another is supposed to be the duration of a year. In
this way, he is able to observe the duration of twelve years in the
single movement of prāņa and apāna.
Like prāņa, time is thought to arise in apāna. It arises in the
heart and goes down to mūlādhāra. Just as Brahmā and others are
supposed to be the causal deities residing in different locations,
namely, in the heart and other places as mentioned above, in the
same way, they are said to have their locations in the heart and
other places down to kanda, etc. The yogin meditates upon the dei-
ties as the causal agents of the stages of childhood, youth, old age,
death, rebirth, and liberation of the embodied soul. From Brahmā
to Anaśrita, these six are considered to be the cause of different
states through which a living being must pass. As they give rise
to these stages of life, in the beginning they are accepted by theINTRODUCTION 17
yogin, but are ultimately rejected by him. To him, the most accept-
able object is the supreme Goddess, the seventh, called unmanā.
Once the aspirant is united with unmanā, it is possible for him to
reach beyond these states.
The movement of apāna ends in the dvādaśānta, otherwise
known as the yoginivaktra. If the yogin is able to find rest there, the
distinctions of the upper and the lower will be put to rest forever.
This method is followed similarly in samāna. Samāna arises in
the navel, flows along the 72,000 nādis of the body, and becomes
manifest in the heart. It flows along the ten principal nādis: idā,
piņgalā, sușumnā, gandhari, hastijihva, alambuśa, puśa, kuhu,
and samkhini; but of these, the first three are the most important.
The heart is like a lotus with eight petals pointing to eight direc-
tions. Because of its association with eight directions, it imitates
the activities of the Lord of directions, and appears to be cruel
or placid. It is known as samāna because it remains uniformly in
the body. Just as an equinox (vișuvat) occurs in prāņa, similarly,
the yogin ascertains five passages (samkrantis) and two equinoxes
(vișuvats) during one day. They also occur during the night in the
same way. It is well known that vișuvats are the equinoxes, when
the day and night are of equal duration. This time is considered to
be very auspicious.
The movement of udāna proceeds from the heart up to the
dvādaśānta, a center of prāņa twelve fingers above the head. The
yogin tries to watch the entire measure of time from one tuți to
sixty years in the single movement of udāna. It is thought to have
the characteristic of vibration (spandarūpa). Vyāna is all-perva-
sive by nature, and so it is free from sequence; still, time arises
there in the form of a subtle vibration.
The subtle forms of the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet
(varņas) arise without any effort, but in their gross forms, the
varņas rise through personal effort. The syllables are of three
kinds: transcendent, subtle, and gross. The transcendent are of
two kinds: paratama is the highest form that preserves a distinc-
tion among the vowels, while nāda is an uncreated sound, hence18 TANTRASĀRA
it is known as anāhata, a sound that resounds ceaselessly without
beginning or end. It is united with all the syllables as their source,
and in this sense is the supreme transcendent form of sound with-
out distinctions.
Chapter Seven
In the seventh chapter, the text presents deśādhva, the path of
space. It consists of objects of multifarious forms made manifest
by the Lord by means of His power of activity. The form of any of
these objects, such as house, courtyard, market, temple, garden,
or forest, which are different from one another, shines to a limited
subject only as being mutually distinct from one another, and also
from the subject himself. To the Lord, who is perfect and there-
fore free from all limitations, all subjects and objects shine as his
very Self. In reality, these forms have their substratum in pure
consciousness, and so they shine nondifferently from it. In its free
will, consciousness (samvid) veils its pure nature and manifests
before the view of the limited subject as śūnya, prāņa, and buddhi,
and from this the embodied soul sees pictures of objects as distinct
from the experiencing subject. Thus, śūnya, prāņa, and buddhi
shine externally as objects, but really they are not different from
the Self.
The adhvas have their locations in śūnya, prāņa, in all the
nādi cakras, and in the body itself. As they proceeded from con-
sciousness, they are to be dissolved into it by involutionary meth-
ods. As the adhvas are vast, it is practically impossible, even for a
yogin, to do so in an eon of ages.
Therefore, one should know, first of all, the real nature of
these adhvas. They have their real resting place in consciousness,
and through it samvid, the entire adhva (consisting of the void,
the intellect, the vital energy, and everything), whether it abides
in the body, the image of a deity, or the sacrificial altar, becomes
complete. When the aspirant is able to realize this, he dissolves
them into Brahmā, the Lord of Brahmānda; then, the tattvas from
:INTRODUCTION 19
purușa to kalā are dissolved into Vişnu, who is their Lord; then,
māyā, the knot (granthi) into Rudra, upon which māyā is to be
dissolved into Īśvara, who is its Lord; then, śuddhavidyā should
be dissolved in Sadāśiva, and Anaśrita Śiva is to be dissolved in
Śakti and Śiva; and finally all of them are dissolved into Parāśiva,
the all-pervading One.
The Tantric text called Trisira Bhairava presents pure con-
sciousness as if it were a tree, consisting of three portions. The
extreme fringe, the root, is known as bodhamūla, where "this-
ness" is predominant; it is the gross form of bodha (conscious-
ness). The middle portion of that tree is not predominantly dual in
nature because, though it shines as "this-ness" here, it has merged
with consciousness. The most perfect is bodha, the uppermost part
of that tree, where there is no separate existence. This state is
known as bodhāgra, the highest consciousness, where everything
has its existence without any separate distinction but shines non-
differently from pure consciousness.
From this, it is evident that all the adhvas, consisting of thirty-
six tattvas, are not different from Parāśiva, the Supreme. One who
is able to realize the most delightful adhvas as nondifferent from
his own consciousness can attain Śivahood without delay.
This chapter gives a detailed account of all the tattvas from the
earth onward, and the bhuvanas contained in each.
Chapter Eight
In the previous chapter we saw that worlds (bhuvanas) are the
expansion of Śakti, which keep all the multifarious forms of sub-
jects and their objects of experience within herself. Permeating
them all is the highest universal, known as Parāmaśiva, who
remains ever shining. That which is less pervasive than the high-
est universal, present in some bhuvanas but absent in others, is
defined as a tattva; for example, solidity, firmness, and grossness
are all qualities found in Brahmāņda alone.
The next discussion in this chapter is the relationship of cause20 TANTRASĀRA
and effect (kāryakāraṇabhāva). According to this system, the
relation is of two kinds, namely, the transcendent (pāramārthika)
and the artificial or fictional (kalpita). The transcendent relation
is such that, because of the Lord's freedom of will, because He is a
free agent, everything beginning with Śiva and ending in the earth
shines nondifferently from Him and rests in Him. The artificial
relation of the cause and the effect, however, is such that every-
thing follows a regular sequence. The relation of cause and effect
is created by His power of niyati. According to this system, the
rod, the wheel, and clay, considered essential for producing a jar,
are only expedients. The real cause is the Lord, for He remains
associated with all of them as the cause and the effect. In order to
support this view, it is stated that it is He who brings all the causes
together and sets them apart. The impelling force of universal
consciousness is considered to be the real agent of everything.
When the potter makes a jar, he himself is one with that universal
consciousness who is the real doer.
Parāśiva is perfect and full with His five śaktis. These śaktis
are inseparably united with their Lord and are manifested in five
aspects by His free will. These five are: cit, ānanda, icchā, jñāna,
and kriyā. The five principles, namely śiva, śakti, sadāśiva,
īśvara, and śuddhavidyā, are the manifestations of the śaktis men-
tioned above. It should be noted here that Śakti is one and affluent
with all the saktis, but due to the dominance of one over the other,
distinctions are also observed among them. For example, in siva
tattva, consciousness (cit) is predominant; when ānanda becomes
dominant, it is called śakti tattva. The lords of the five pure prin-
ciples are Śiva, Śakti, Sadāśiva, Īśvara, and Ananta. These five
beginning with Śiva and ending in Ananta have their respective
gaņas or hosts. They are named śāmbhava, śākta, mantreśvara,
and mantra. This is known as pure path or adhva.
The impure adhva is created by the will of the Lord for ful-
filling the desires of limited souls. Aghora is the creator of the
impure adhva by causing agitation (kșobha) in māyā.INTRODUCTION 21
The principle called māyā is the material cause of the insen-
tient universe. It should be remembered in this context that the
māyā śakti, belonging to the Lord, is that which manifests māyā,
the material cause, and is quite different from māyā, the principle
or tattva. The entire universe is born of māyā tattva, from which
kalā is born. It, in turn, is responsible for the rise of limited power
of action in the limited soul. Māyā veils the pure conscious state of
the self for which it loses its power of knowledge and activity.
Kalā, though born of māyā tattva and being impelled by its
force, becomes attached to the limited soul. These two, that is,
kaļā and aņu, remain firmly attached to each other, so they cannot
be easily differentiated. Those who remain under the influence of
māyā tattva fail to get release so long as they do not receive grace
from Ananta, the Lord of māyā tattva. Only then can puruṣas
differentiate themselves from māyā, and as a result they become
vijñānākala souls. Similarly, when one realizes his distinction
from prakrti, he never goes below prakrti; and when one realizes
one's distinction from kalā, one doesn't go beyond kalā tattva.
When the residual trace of the malas become totally absent from
the soul, he becomes one with Śiva.
It is to be remembered in this connection that the kalā tattva is
the giver of limited activity to the limited soul. The impure vidyā
bestows on the insentient subject a limited cognitive power. Only
because of its presence is the limited subject able to see the real
nature of the intellect, and distinguish happiness and others from
the mass of objects which are reflected in the mirror of buddhi. "I
know something" and "I do something" are the forms of judgment
aroused by vidyā and kalā, respectively.
These rāga, vidyā, kalā, kāla, and niyati are of two types;
because of grace, they are considered pure and therefore function
as means for the attainment of Śivahood. Kalā tattva becomes
pure when it consists of activities like worshipping, etc.; rāga tat-
tva becomes so when it gives rise to attachment to the Lord. Vidyā
becomes pure when it causes discernment regarding the Lord. In
:22 TANTRASĀRA
the same way, kāla provides potency to the teachings regarding
the Lord (tadupadeśādi vișayameva kalanam), while niyati sup-
ports the soul in remaining steadfast in His worship.
The group of kalā and other tattvas are different according to
the difference of the individual souls, for the activity in them is
seen to rise differently in different limited subjects.
It is noteworthy that the agenthood with the characteristic of
limited nature gives rise to pradhana, the equilibrium of the three
guņas, i.e., sattva, rajas, and tamas. The supreme Subject in the
beginning is made limited by māyā, which takes away all of His
glory. He is bestowed again with a little of His glory by means of
kalā tattva and so on. Thus, He becomes a paśu, a limited subject,
and the māyā, kāla, rāga, vidyā, niyati, kalā tattvas serve Him as
veils (kañcukas).
The author further points out that prakrti is of two kinds. One
is the equilibrium of the guņas; the other is guna tattva itself
which, being disturbed by the predominant Lord of the tattva,
causes agitation (kșobha) in prakrti, which in turn gives rise to the
principle of buddhi. Prakrti should be accepted as the recipient of
the agitation, otherwise it would not be possible for the liberated
soul to remain uninvolved in bondage. According to this system,
the disturbance (kșobha) in prakrti is caused by the Lord Himself.
Ahamkāra arises from buddhi, which sees the light of puruşa
as if in a mirror that has become slightly impure, and because
of its contact with objects it makes one experience "I know this"
and "I do this." Thus it feels identity with the object and thinks
of itself as "I." Buddhi receives the reflection of objects and at
the same time, though insentient, manifests the light of purusa.
From ahamkāra that is predominantly sattvika in nature come
the five inner and external sense organs, from rajasa ahamkāra
arises manas, and from the tamasa nature of ahamkāra the five
tanmātras are born. Thus the tanmatras give rise to five gross
elements: ether (nabhas), air (vāyu), fire (tejas), water (apa), and
earth (prthvi).
This chapter discusses all thirty-six principles, which are mutu-INTRODUCTION 23
ally related to one another. These are classified in a threefold divi-
sion consisting of nara, Śakti, and Śiva. Śiva pervades all by His
characteristic nature of luminous consciousness. The principle in
which this characteristic of light is more prominent is considered
more extensive than the other. For example, Śiva is more extensive
than Śakti, while the latter is more so than nara.
Chapter Nine
This chapter classifies all the tattvas grouped under fifteen
aspects as viewed by the seven kinds of knowing subjects: śiva,
mantramaheśvara, mantreśvara, mantra, vijñānākala, pralayā-
kala, and sakala. These subjects each possess one of seven śaktis;
thus counting the saktis and the possessors of these saktis, the
number becomes fourteen. Including svarūpa, which refers to the
"object in itself," with these fourteen, each of the tattvas from
prthvi to prakrti has fifteen aspects.
The Lord possesses three śaktis in the form of the goddesses
as parā, parāparā, and āparā parā. The transcendent śakti func-
tions as the subject (pramātā). She is parā śakti, who is insep-
arably united with the supreme Subject. The goddess parāparā
śakti is the instrument (pramāņa), and āparā śakti operates as the
object of experience (prameya).
The earth and other tattvas have their distinctive svarūpa;
that is, they are objects in themselves. In other words, the tattvas
from prakrti down to the earth shine as objects without having
the reflection of any of the limiting adjuncts of the subject and its
instruments. This is said to be the pure nature of each object; its
existence does not rest in the subject. The object has its rest in
itself, meaning that it exists independently of the limits of ordi-
nary sense perception.
It should be noted in this context that the object as such shines
in this distinctive way by the grace of āparā śakti. The pure objec-
tive aspect of all the tattvas from the earth to prakrti broadly
comes under the nara group, the basic concept of Trika as charac-24 TANTRASĀRA
terized by nara, Śakti, and Śiva. When śaktis related to different
subjects become predominant, however, and the object in its turn
rests in them, this is known as its sākta form. It shines thus by the
grace of paraparā śakti. These śākta forms are seven, because
the numbers of śaktis related to the different subjects are seven
in number; but when the subject possessing these śaktis becomes
predominant and the objects rest in the knowing subjects, it is
known to be of the form of Śiva, who is the possessor of the śaktis
(śaktimān). They shine thus by the grace of parā śakti. The subject
characterized as possessing a particular śakti, that is, a śaktimān,
is of seven kindş.
The first of these seven subjects, known as sakala, has vidyā
and kalā as its saktis, but they lie dormant in pralayakala souls,
and though they are abiding in vijñānākala, it is as if they are
disappearing. In the subject known as mantra, vidyā and kalā
function as pure knowledge (śuddhvidyā), about to become awake,
but the residual trace of it is still there. Mantreśa knowing subject
is free from the above residual traces and śuddhavidyā has awak-
ened fully in them. This very śuddhavidyā is going to become
icchāśakti in mantramaheśvara, while in siva it becomes fully
manifest icchā with the characteristic of svātantryaśakti.

It has been stated before that the universe is characterized by
the three: nara, Śakti, and Śiva. The aspect known as svarūpa is
the sentient object in which objectivity is predominant and where
the subjectivity of consciousness is totally absent. Śiva is of the
characteristic of pure consciousness; He is the supreme Subject
(parāpramātā). His Śakti, which shines as icchā, jñāna, and
kriyā, manifests herself as six knowing subjects (pramātās). Of
the six, the first three, mantramaheśvara, mantreśvara, and man-
:26 TANTRASĀRA
tra, do not have any objects, so therefore are known as pure sub-
jects (śuddha grahaka), but vijñānākala, pralayākala, and sakala
are considered as impure subjects.
The author shows, as an example, how the earth principle
(prthvi tattva) shines in relation to pramātā and prameyas. The
light that shines nondifferently from the Earth (dharā) is Śiva. He
supports his view by quoting the śruti Dharāmantramaheśvara:
being impelled by the will of Śiva leads to dharāmantreśa for
bestowing siddhis on those who are desirous of it, and who are
connected with dharā. Mantras are the vācakas of the super-
intending. deities of different bhuvanas under pṛthivī tattva, in
accordance with the procedure prescribed by the non-Śaiva doc-
trines. He remains as pralayākala knowing subject abiding in the
earth principle (dharāpralayakevali) and will have his egoism
abide in dharā.
Then, the author shows how all the tattvas abide as prāņa śakti,
related to the knowing subject (pramātā). One single prāņa, con-
sisting of sixteen tutis, extends until the emergence of the (vedya),
the thing to be known. Among the sixteen tutis, the first is the
undifferentiated one, the second is the one that manifests the gra-
haka, the last tuți is inseparable from the object, and the one pre-
ceding the last has the form of a fully manifest grahaka. Thus,
twelve tutis out of sixteen are divided broadly into two divisions.
The first six are of the nature of nirvikalpaka and the next six are
the characteristic of parāparā, from where vikalpa begins to rise.
All the subjects from mantramaheśvara down to sakala shine
along the twelve tutis, two for each subject, while the first tuți, it
should be remembered, is the location for śakti.
The fifteen aspects with their varied distinctions are observed
in two tutis each. Just as in the cognition of a jar, the character-
istics of the fifteen aspects can be watched, in the same way, this
is observed in the vital energy when it is engaged in grasping any
object. It has been hinted earlier that when a knowing subject,
such as a sakala, does not participate as a subject that is, when
it is taken as a svarūpa-the aspect of fifteen becomes thirteen.INTRODUCTION 27
Thus, the number of aspects diminishes gradually by twos. Then
finally, as distinction disappears, the number of tutis diminishes.
At last, the yogin is able to attain absorption in Śiva. Here, the
time unit consists of two tutis-the first tuti is considered as being
full, and the other has the character of Śiva-Śakti. It has been
stated in the Tantrāloka that one who is able to absorb oneself in
the second tuți is sure to attain the power of omniscience.
Now the author explains the nature of states known as waking,
dreaming, deep sleep, the fourth (turya), and beyond the fourth
(turyātīta). All subjects, along with their śaktis, are knowers of
the objects of all the tattvas. These states are the manifestations
of consciousness conditioned by knowables (prameyas): The
prameya state is said to be the chief characteristic of the waking
state (jāgrat), otherwise known as (addhistheya), the locus.
In the Mālinīvijaya it is known as pindastha, for the yogin,
taking his stand on dharā and others as the base, is able to iden-
tify himself with them. But to the jñānin who is well advanced in
meditation, it is known as sarvatobhadra, for to him, the jāgrat
state is one which fully pervades the objects of experience. Tech-
nically, the waking state is the object of experience (prameya) or
adhistheya, the base, while the dreaming state (svāpna) is known
as pramāņa or adhisthana, and adhisthātā or the subject is the
pramātā in deep sleep (sușupti).
All the states have subdivisions of their own: (1) jāgrat-jāgrat,
jāgrat-svapna, jāgrat-sușupti, and jāgrat-turya; (2) svapna-jāgrat,
svapna-svapna, svapna-sușupti, and svapna-turya; and (3) sus-
upti-jāgrat, sușupti-svapna, sușupti-sușupti, and sușupti-turya.
Jāgrat is known to have four portions. The object that is expe-
rienced is abuddha, insentient, and the instrument of experience
is called buddha; right knowledge, born from instrumentality, is
known as prabuddha and suprabuddha. Of these two, prabuddha
is of the nature of buddhi, while suprabuddha is free from impuri-
ties of the object of experience and therefore is of the character-
istic of resting in the self. This chart may be of some help for the
understanding of the scheme:28 TANTRASĀRA

Pindastha may be explained as that which abides in the body.
The abode of all paths (adhvas) is the vital energy (prana) and
intention/thought (samkalpa). Everything lies in the vital energy
and samkalpa, hence it is known as abiding there, and therefore
it is also known as padastha. Rupayati is the one that gives form
to the respective objects, and then withdraws them into the Self,
which is none other than the atman. The Self, where they abide, is
identical with the object. This identification and merger is known
as rūpastha, but the form which is beyond all these is called
rūpātīta. To the jñānin, svapna, whose nature is vikalpika, is con-
sidered to be vyāpti, for his jñāna is then free from external con-
ditions, and he is the active agent in changing and arranging the
order of his thoughts. In the state of deep sleep, the jñānin feels
freedom from limitations; therefore, it is considered as mahāv-
yāpti. The jñānin in the turya state sees the universe collected
together like an amalaka fruit in the palm of his hand; therefore,
the name is pracaya.
Jagrat is the state which a sakala knowing subject enjoys,
while svapna is enjoyed by a pralayākala, and sușupti by a vijñā-
nākala subject. Mantra and mantramaheśvara subjects have their
abode in the turya level, but in the turyātīta state, all beings,
whether they are prameyas or pramātās, become one with Śiva-
Śakti and shine nondifferently with it.
The fifteen aspects mentioned above are also observed in five
states known as jāgrat, etc., thus:INTRODUCTION 29

Chapter Ten
Chapter Ten begins with a description of the general features of
the subtle units constituting the manifested universe called kalās.
Abhinavagupta defines a tattva as that which threads through all
the worlds (bhuvanas), and kalā is that which invariably abides in
the group of tattvas.
The number of kalās are four, i.e., nivrtti, pratisthā, vidyā,
and śāntā. The four andas: pārthiva, prākṛta, māyīya, and śāktā
are made of these kalās.
Nivṛtti kalā operates in the earth principle (pṛthivī tattva),
pratisthā from the water principle (jala) to prakṛti, vidyā kalā
from above prakṛti to māyā, and from above māyā, śāktā operates.
Śiva is considered to be beyond the kalās, for He is niskala; how-INTRODUCTION 31
ever, for the purpose of meditation, He is said to possess a kalā
named śāntātitā. The sphere or egg (anda) is a kind of covering
which exists up to Śakti, and though the bhuvanas exist under the
Śiva tattva, they are said to be of the form of the void and there-
fore do not serve as a covering.
Chapter Eleven
This chapter discusses śaktipāta, but before giving a detailed
account of it, the text deals with issues concerning the occurrence
of the descent of grace in a particular individual. This has been
dealt with in detail in our translation of the text and the additional
notes. The author presents and critiques three standard views
regarding śaktipāta: (1) bondage, or samsāra, has ignorance as
its root. When the rise of right knowledge occurs, the descent of
grace also comes into being. This view has been refuted by the
author. (2) Next, the view known as karmasāmya, that is, the bal-
ance of two opposing actions, is summarized. According to this
theory, when karmasāmya occurs, śaktipāta is sure to take place.
The author does not accept this view either. (3) The third view
considers the ripening of mala (mala paripaka) as the cause of
śaktipāta, which is also rejected by the author.
According to Abhinavagupta, these views may be acceptable
to the followers of dualist philosophies, but according to the non-
dual system known as Parameśvarādvayavāda (known to modern
scholarship as Kashmir Śaivism), they are not tenable. According
to this system, the Great Lord, in the course of His play, veils His
true nature and assumes a limited nature. When the concealment
of His pure nature disappears, the limited self becomes the recipi-
ent of śaktipāta and is able to attain the proximity of svarūpa,
the true form of the Lord, either by following a sequence or by
attaining proximity to the Lord without sequence. The Great Lord
(Maheśvara) is in essence free, and the causal agent of śaktipāta,
for which he does not depend on anything or anyone. The person
who is eager to have worldly and otherworldly enjoyment (bhoga)
:32 TANTRASĀRA
can also attain śaktipāta, but for the bhoga to be manifested, some
actions must be performed. Likewise, the person who has the
desire for both bhoga and mokșa is also required to perform cer-
tain acts in order to attain them.
It has been stated in the Tantrāloka that śaktipāta is, in
essence, the descent of the highest light on the limited soul. It is
free from all limitations and is of the characteristic of pure con-
sciousness. However, śaktipāta of a slightly lower nature, though
shining with all the fullness of consciousness, is conditioned with
the limitations of bhoga.
It should be remembered in this context that śaktipāta is
really the nature of the iccha or will of the Lord. It is He who,
by His freedom of will, veils Himself and manifests all subjects
and objects as limited entities. Due to His activity of conceal-
ment, known as tirodhāna, the objects to be enjoyed shine before
the view of the limited subjects. Thus, He willfully and playfully
binds Himself, then removes these bonds, and finally shines in
the fullness of jñāna and kriyā. His play of freedom is such that,
though He assumes limited forms in an outward journey of con-
cealing Himself by manifesting and sustaining the universe, He
makes a return journey to Himself through the descent of grace
and revelation of Himself to Himself, ultimately shining in His
pristine pure nature.
Grace is said to be of two types: the higher, that is, the more
pure and potent form, is called para; and the less potent form is
apara. The para form of śaktipāta is bestowed only by the Lord
Himself, but the apara kind of grace is bestowed by the super-
intending lords of the domain over which they have control. The
form of śaktipāta bestowed by them does not lead the soul to
attain Śiva-hood, hence it is inferior to the one which flows from
the Lord Himself. This apara grace is further divided into manda,
less keen, and tivra, exceedingly keen. When apara śaktipāta is
manda, it gives birth to right judgment in the soul, upon which
the ability to distinguish between prakrti and puruşa occurs. The
result of this type of discrimination is that the soul does not abideINTRODUCTION 33
in the worlds below prakrti. When the descent is exceedingly keen
(tivra), however, the soul by its merit is able to discriminate his
own being from kalā tattva, and as a result becomes one of the
Vijñānākala souls. He even arises to the level of mantra when the
Lord wills it so.
After śaktipāta, the author explains the nature of concealment
(tirobhāvaa) as one of the five functions (pañcakrtya) of the Lord.
Tirobhāva is of two types: niyati krama, when the Lord is seen as
the one who ordains the law and the one who bestows the fruits
of action in accordance with the merit and demerit of the soul.
. Here, He takes recourse to niyati, and therefore the functions of
creation, maintenance, and dissolution flow from Him. But above
māyāņda, that is, at the level of śakti, which is beyond the sphere
of karma, there continues creation of immense nature. This cre-
ation is known as mahāsrști. Similarly, the pralaya of greater
nature, that is, the highest form of dissolution, is also performed
at this stage. Creation and dissolution of this nature are performed
by the Lord without taking recourse to niyati, but those which are
performed from the level of māyā downward are accomplished by
his taking recourse to niyati. Therefore, at that stage, though He
is, in essence, always prabuddha, the enlightened one, he behaves
in the worldly level as an unenlightened one.
Chapter Twelve
In this chapter, the author presents and substantiates the rea-
sons for the performance of initiations (dīkṣā). In addressing the
question of the necessity of dīkṣā, the author states that initia-
tion alone is the means that leads the soul to enjoyment (bhoga)
and finally helps one to attain liberation. Primarily, dīkṣā sanc-
tifies the soul and produces in it the competency for receiving
knowledge (jñāna), yoga, etc., for without obtaining dīkṣā fol-
lowing the course of Śaiva Yoga would not be possible. Therefore
dīkṣā is considered to be the preliminary step in the progression
from samskāra, to the proper practice of yoga, to perfection in7
34 TANTRASĀRA
yoga, and finally to liberation; or, to put it another way: initiation,
samskāra, perfection in mantra, worldly and otherworldly enjoy-
ment (bhoga), and finally, liberation.
It should be remembered that the highest kind of knowledge
is obtained from the holy texts (sāstra). One who is uninitiated is
not considered to be the right person to receive instruction in the
śāstras; therefore, dīkṣā is essential. On the other hand, those who
have received the highest kind of grace, and thus earned compe-
tence, do not require any formal dīkṣā, for their innate knowledge
serves as dīkṣā for them. To those who are unable to follow the
path of knowledge, however, the easier path is recommended; it is
predominantly of a ritualistic nature.
Snāna, bathing, is the preliminary step to dīkṣā. Generally,
bathing cleanses impurities of the body, but esoterically it helps
one to become absorbed into Parameśvara. Ordinarily, bathing is
performed with water; according to this system it is a little bit dif-
ferent: one who goes to take a bath should think of the presence of:
Śiva in his eight forms. By uttering a mantra one should perform
one's bath with the eight prescribed materials. Bathing is of two
types, external and internal. The former is done by earth, water,
the sacred ashes, etc., but the internal one is performed by one's
concentration in various locations of the body. The object with
which one performs one's bath is charged with a mantra and thus
helps the body to become steady in reality, refreshes the body, and
cleanses it of impurities.
Chapter Thirteen
Here the author explains the necessity of and reasons for the ritual
procedures that are to be performed on hilltops, river banks, and
other holy spots. Though those places are considered to be auspi-
cious, they are really external, and thus of little help for attaining
siddhis, in contrast to the internal seats (pithas), which are much
more useful, because they concentrate the vital energy in differ-
ent locations in the body, and through this one is able to attainINTRODUCTION 35
liberation. Just as there are many sacred places existing externally,
in the same way, there are many sacred places located inside the
human body, and are divided into groups known as pitha, ирарі-
tha, sandohaka, kșetra, and upakșetra. The group of pithas con-
sists of three sacred locations: kāmarūpa, pūrṇagiri, and uddi-
yana. The kāmarūpa pitha is of the form of icchā; the other two
are of the nature of nāda and bindu, respectively, and have their
locations at the right and left side of the body. The following chart
shows further details:
(b) Upapīthas are three

5. Vārāņasī 6. Kālinga 7. Kulūtā 8. Lāhulā
(e) Upakșetra: the eight tips of the lotus
1. Viraja 2. Erudikā 3. Hālā 4. Elāpūḥ
5. Kṣīrikā 6. Puri 7. Māyāpuri 8. Marudeśa
(f) Upasandohaka are the junctures of the eight petals of the
heart lotus with the center
1. Jalandhara 2. Naipāla 3. Kaśmīrā 4. Gargikā
5. Harah 6. Mlecchadigdvāravṛtti 7. Kurukșetra
8. Khetaka
Although outer sacred places are of no help in attaining release,
they are suitable places for worship, because deities who are well
versed in jñāna and yoga are born there and have sanctified the
place. Moreover, by staying in those places, devoted people may
become recipients of jñāna and yoga; therefore, aspirants make
pilgrimages to sacred places. The author further clarifies that such
places are to be selected as the setting for rituals as they bestow
satisfaction to the heart lotus.36 TANTRASĀRA
For the purpose of worship, one should attain the state of a pure
heart and stand outside the ritual space and perform nyāsa with
either the mātṛkā or mālinī orders of the Sanskrit alphabet, or both.

The nyāsa of mālinī is:
nrrīļļīthcdhīņuūbkkhgghniavbhyddhth jh
njrtp chlāsaḥhşkşmśamteaioaud ph.INTRODUCTION 37
Performing nyāsa with the mālinī order is quite different from
mātṛkā nyāsa. Nyāsa is performed first in the fingers, which is
followed by nyāsa in the body. Mālinī and mātṛkā both are Śiva
and Śakti by nature. The supreme form of Śiva in this tradition is
Bhairava; the mass of phonemes (śabdarāśi) is contained indivis-
ibly and inseparably within Himself. This śabdarāśi is also Śakti
Herself, because it is she who, like a mother, gives birth to her
creation in its differentiated forms; therefore, she is called mātṛkā,
the mother. Mālinī is put on by the Rudras like a mala, or gar-
land, by which they bestow enjoyment and liberation. In deriving
the word mala, the author says that the phoneme "ma" represents
samhara; that is, withdrawal.. The phoneme "ra" means granting,
and since "ra" and "la" are identical, "la" means to receive.
Nyāsa should be performed in order to bring into predomi-
nance the sākta body in the worshipper. It is done in the sacrifi-
cial vessel (arghapatra). The teacher (ācārya) then purifies all the
articles of worship with a few drops of water from the arghapatra.
After worshipping the external deities outside the door, the ācārya
enters within and watches the interior with the vision of the Lord.
If the disciple is desirous of release, the ācārya sits facing north;
if otherwise, he sits facing east. The highest light of conscious-
ness is the middle, from which the other directions proceed. Just
as the Lord manifests the respective distinctions of directions, so
does the sun. It is the sun which represents the Lord's jñāna śakti.
While deciding directions, one should think of the unity of the
three-namely, the self, the sun, and the Lord-as coalesced into
one. It is followed by the ritual practice of burning of the physical
and the subtle bodies, and by this relinquishing I-consciousness
in the physical body. However, it should be pointed out that the
physical body is not actually burned; rather, offerings represent-
ing the body, etc. are consigned to the fire. Afterwards, whatever
remain as ashes are regarded as nothing but the residual traces of
the former bodies.
Then, the ācārya should remain steady in the state of pure
consciousness. It is like a tranquil sea from where the creative
:38 TANTRASĀRA
consciousness (samvit) begins to break into waves. The first cre-
ative impulse of consciousness causes the pure body to rise. This
newly born body is characterized by the unlimited power of Bhai-
rava. This body is really the supreme form (para mūrti) of the
Lord and is characterized by the mantra "om ham." Other nyāsas
are performed so that all the tattvas may rise there. All the śaktis
associated with nine principles are to be worshipped, after which
the sixfold nyāsa follows.
There are five states, namely, waking (jāgrat), dream (svapna),
deep sleep (susupti), the fourth (turya), and beyond the fourth
(turiyātīta); but anuttara is beyond them all. This is called the
state or condition of one's own nature (svabhāvadaśā). These
states have Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Īśvara, Sadaśiva, and Śiva
as their lords, and are thus are associated with the real cause of
thirty-six categories. Because of this, when nyāsa is performed in
the body, the entire universe becomes one with the real cause of
the tattvas, from which pure creation begins to manifest. Mūrti
nyāsa and other practices are performed only for the purpose of
attaining nonduality.
It may be asked: Is there any use of further nyāsa after the
burning of the body once one has attained steadiness in tranquil
Śiva? To answer this question, the author states that Śiva is not a
static reality that is entirely separate, transcendent, and excluded
from all the other tattvas. Rather, Śiva is the great light of con-
sciousness which shines in multifarious forms.
After consecrating the body, the worshipper then performs
sulabja nyāsa in the vital energy. One should think of earth, water,
fire, and wind elements as located above, and supporting the
energy which is situated four digits below the navel. One digit
each is occupied by earth and the others. The bulb (kanda) is
supposed to be like a boat that helps one cross the ocean. The air
abides there, and the sky is lying within it. Then the worshipper
thinks of the staff named ananta going up to lambikā, the aper-
ture below the palate (tālurandhra). It contains all the tanmātras,
subtle elements, etc. Above it is the knot of māyā, where four legsINTRODUCTION 39
of the simhasana, in the form of a lion, stand. Dharma, jñāna,
vairagya, and aiśvarya assume these forms, whereas adharma,
ajñāna, avairagya, and anaiśvarya are the joining planks. They
occupy southeast, southwest, northwest, and northeast, respec-
tively; adharma and others occupy the east, south, west, and north.
Above māyā and below the trident, the simhāsana is covered
with two sheets of cloth: the lower one represents māyā for veil-
ing the real nature of manifestation, and the upper one is for the
purpose of covering māyā itself. The worshipper then meditates
on the vidyā lotus; that is, śuddhavidyā as a white lotus. Its pet-
als are occupied by the saktis known as vāmā and others, with
Brahmā, Vişnu, and Rudra representing creation, maintenance,
and dissolution. Object of knowledge (meya), knowledge (māna),
and subject (matr) are superintending, seated on three mandalas,
one above the other, from lambikā onward. Iśvara is located above
Rudra, and further above, Sadāśiva is lying, like a corpse, but he
is ever awake and is of the nature of reflecting nāda, primal sound.
Three lotuses have grown from his navel, consisting of a three-
pronged trident, piercing three apertures of His head; the trident
is of the nature of nadānta and made luminous by the three śaktis,
i.e., śakti, vyāpinī, and samanā. Above them is the aunmanasa,
where one should meditate on the supreme Goddess as having been
made of all the tattvas as her seat. In the process of worship, one
offers the entire universe to her. Meditation (dhyāna), mantra rep-
etition (japa), etc., are to be performed internally.
This is followed by external rituals. If the disciple desires ini-
tiation, he is given consecratory rites (adhivāsana). This is per-
formed in order to make him worthy to receive various samskāras,
and to cause the deity to become intent on him.
Then the author explains in detail how adhivāsana is performed.
It is to be noted here that both guru and the disciple pass the night
in the place of adhivāsana. If the disciple sees any inauspicious
dream, he reports it to the teacher the next morning. The teacher
then allays the inauspicious elements by performing certain rituals.
Then, the teacher worships the Lord. When this is complete,40 TANTRASĀRA
the teacher enters inside the body of the disciple by the outlet of
the prāņa in order to come in contact with the six presiding dei-
ties located in the six centers. Then, meditating on the forty-eight
samskāras, rites are performed in the body of the "newly born
child"; that is, the disciple, through contact with Brahmā, Vişņu,
Rudra, Īśvara. Sadāśiva, and Śiva, located in the hṛdaya, kantha,
tālu, ghrumadhya, lalața, and brahmarandhra, respectively. The
eight rites of purification are meditated upon differently in each
of the six centers. Thus the number becomes complete, and as a
result the disciple becomes twice born (dvija). Then, causing the
prāņa of the disciple to rest in the respective places for a while,
the teacher comes out and gives him the mantra along with flow-.
ers. Then he tells him the code of conduct (samaya) which he
should follow as long as he lives.
Chapter Fourteen
:
This chapter describes the procedure of initiation called putraka.
On the third day after anointment, a mandala or diagram con-
sisting of three tridents with a lotus on each prong is drawn on
the ground. All the rituals described in this chapter are to be
performed in relation to it. Those groups of deities called the
"external retinues" and the "deities at the door" are worshipped
outside. Then, in front of the mandala, moving from northeast
to southeast, Ganesa, one's teacher (guru), the teacher's teacher
(paramagurus), the lineage of previous teachers, the yoginis, the
Goddess of Speech (Vāgīśvarī), and kșetrapālas are worshipped.
After receiving their permission, the teacher worships the nine
paths (adhvas) in the tridents. On the middle prong of the middle-
most trident, the Goddess Śrīparā and Bhairava are worshipped;
the Goddess Śrīāparā is worshipped on the left, and the Goddess
Śrīparāparā on the right. On the trident to the right, Śrīparāparā is
placed in the middle prong, while on the trident to the left Śrīāparā
is placed in the middle. Bhagavatī is the supreme Goddess, and
because of her presence everywhere, all activities become perfect,INTRODUCTION 41
and therefore all the rituals should be performed in the middle-
most prong of the middle trident.
Then, the teacher meditates on the unification of the jar
(kumbha), kalaśa, mandala, agni, and the self as one. He cog-
nizes the all-pervading aham as being present everywhere through
the method known as mantranādi prayoga.
He sees to it that all the articles for the ritual are not collected
in a miserly way. If the person is poor, on the other hand, mahā-
mandala yāga is not recommended.
Then, the author describes animal sacrifice (paśu homa).
When it is complete, the teacher brings the disciple in front of him
and performs all the adhvanyāsas in his body, and purifies his
inauspicious deeds, provided he is desirous of bhoga. In the case
of the disciple who desires mokșa, both his auspicious and inaus-
picious deeds should be purified. Then, the teacher, reflecting on
the main mantra, purifies all the adhvas abiding in the disciple's
body, meditating on the nondual nature of Śiva.
After attaining oneness of consciousness, the teacher abides
in the body of the disciple from his toes to the top of his head,
and having absorbed the consciousness of the disciple's body, the
teacher rests, along with the disciple, in the ocean of bliss, which
is in essence the wealth of freedom. The teacher merges along
with him into the Lord, resplendent with icchā, jñāna, and kriyā.
Thus, the disciple becomes non-different from the Lord. If the
disciple is desirous of bhoga, the teacher unites him with that par-
ticular principle. Finally, the teacher bestows on him a pure body
for performing deeds in mundane life.
Chapter Fifteen
This chapter describes the initiation given to a dying person. The
recipient of such a dīkṣā is a person who has been suffering from
an incurable disease. The teacher, after making nyāsa of all the
adhvas in him and purifying them one after the other, performs
a nyāsa called marmakartani, by which he severs all the delicate
:
:42 TANTRASĀRA
joints and brings his consciousness to brahmarandhra. For the
purpose of unification (yojana), he then offers the final oblation
into the fire. Thus, the disciple becomes one with Parāmaśiva.
Chapter Sixteen
In this chapter, the author describes the method of initiation that
is given to those who are dead and who are not present during the
procedure. For the purpose of bestowing it on the departed soul,
the teacher brings nearby a device known as mahājāla prayoga,
the application of a large net. To the person who is absent but not
dead, this procedure is not followed.
Chapter Seventeen
This chapter gives the procedure known as lingoddhāra; it simply
means "rescuing a person from a fallen state." It is performed for
one who has gone away from the right track by receiving initia-
tion from persons belonging to other systems, such as Vaisnava,
Bauddha, and other lower Śaiva schools. However, the teacher will
grant this type of initiation only when he becomes convinced that
śaktipāta has definitely occurred in a prospective disciple.
According to the author, the Trika is the superior system, for all
the other śāstras, as preached by Kapila and others, lead the seeker
to attain release from prakrti, but they do not help him attain
release from māyā. On the other hand, Saivāgamas, as expounded
by the Trika, lead everybody to the ultimate immediately.
Chapter Eighteen
In this chapter the method of abhiśeka is described. Abhiśeka is
given both to putraka and acārya types of disciples, provided they
have received the sabīja form of initiation. The term sabīja means
"with seed," but it really signifies that this form of initiation is
given to those who are competent enough to follow certain strictINTRODUCTION 43
rules of conduct during their lifetime. On the other hand, the nir-
bīja form of initiation is given to old and decrepit persons who are
less assiduous and therefore unable to follow strict codes of con-
duct as enjoined by the holy text.
Abhiseka is restrictive in the sense that not everybody is con-
sidered competent enough to receive it. In particular, ācāryābhi-
şeka is given to those who, after receiving initiation, have attained
proficiency in āgamic knowledge; those who have restraint over
their body, mind, and speech; those who follow the duties as
enjoined by the scripture; those who have become proficient in
unification of the adhvas in their respective order (adhvānusan-
dhāna); those who have gained perfection-in the highest knowl-
edge by listening to it from their teacher; and those who continue
mental exertion for retaining it, followed by meditative thought
(śruta, cinta, and bhāvanā) terminating in identity with Śiva. The
author categorically states that even after receiving abhișeka, only
one who has really attained perfection in the highest knowledge is
worthy of bestowing grace to others.
Chapter Nineteen
The funeral sacrifice is the final rite for every human being. Ini-
tiation is given during that period only to a person who, though he
belonged to the highest Śaiva order, on account of some unknown
factor lost the tradition and expired without performing the rites of
atonement before death. Such a person is given initiation when his
body is placed on the funeral pyre.
For the purpose of rescuing the deceased, all the rituals are
performed upon the body. The final offering into the fire (pūr-
nāhuti) is performed by burning the body. In order to convince
ignorant people, the person who initiates causes the dead body to
shake. He does this by means of kriyā, jñāna, and yoga, though it
is not necessary for the release of the soul.
If the deceased person cannot be given initiation during the
burning of his corpse, he may be given initiation during his śrād-44 TANTRASĀRA
dha rite. The teacher takes a ball of rice in his hand and meditates
on it as the form of the energizing Śakti, and by doing so, the soul
of the dead person is possessed. This food is considered to be the
portion of animal-like quality of the soul and is really the thing to
be enjoyed. When both the bhogya and bhogya śakti become uni-
fied by the meditation of the acārya, it becomes fit to be offered
to the supreme enjoyer, the Lord. Thus, leaving the animalistic
portion behind, which is the essence of the bhogya, the bhogya
śakti, along with the self, is offered to the supreme bhoktā, the
Lord. In this way, the soul becomes identical with Him. It should
be remembered that the final procedure is preceded by the homa
sacrifice and other rituals.
In this chapter, the author raises a relevant question: whether
for the knower of reality (tattva jñānin), rituals such as śraddhā
and others are necessary or not. He answers saying that when, by
the light of true knowledge, darkness has been totally removed
from the enlightened one, there is no need of a final ritual like
antyeśti śrāddha, etc. But, for the people who had been closely
associated with the departed one, the day of his unification with
the Supreme is observed as a day of parva, the day which causes
fullness of consciousness in him.
Chapter Twenty
The present section discusses the disciple's obligations, known as
śeșavartana, the duties that should be carried out until the end of
his life. These duties are of three kinds: obligatory (nitya), occa-
sional (naimittika), and kāmya, those performed for the fulfill-
ment of some desire.
The nitya procedure is described in the following way: One
should get up early in the morning and call to mind one's desired
deity first. After completing his essential activities, like wash-
ing, etc., and cleansing himself, he should take his seat facing
north. He then purifies his body, the place where he sits, and his
mind. Then he performs nyāsa upon the appropriate places withINTRODUCTION 45
the mantra, followed by displaying an appropriate mudrā. Then
he performs dhyāna in two ways: first, abiding in duality, and
then in a mixed dual-nondual way. Next, mental worship of the
deity is performed in the body, then in prāņa, in the intellect, and
finally in the void (vyoma). This is followed by japa, and finally
the completed sequence of worship is offered to the deity. All this
is to be performed every day, in every sandhya, for the purpose of
achieving identification with the deity. Four sandhyas have been
mentioned in Chapter Six. According to the author, through medi-
tation during sandhya, endless absorption (anantatanmayi bhāva)
in the Supreme comes about, which in turn gives birth to a lasting
state.
The worshipper should worship his deity in the altar (sthan-
dila). He should view it as a clear sky with the characteristics
of consciousness, where all the deities are shining as reflected
therein. Viewing bare open ground really signifies invocation
(āvāhana). This practice ensures that the disciple identifies with
the desired deity and the highest mantra.
Invocation of the all-pervading Lord is not possible; only
desire (vāsanā) for the Lord is invoked and drawn within, since
the great Lord can neither be invoked or withdrawn.
The person who is totally absorbed in the highest mantra in the
way stated above becomes free from the stains of animal proclivi-
ties and is finally able to put an end to all bonds by the blow of
bhakti. After that, whatever remains is the most agreeable object
for the worshipper.
Then, the author describes the activities related to the parvas,
which are performed occasionally by the disciple.
Chapter Twenty-One
This chapter presents the authority of āgamas. In the Tantrāloka,
āgama has been defined as a well-known fact of old, as prasid-
dhi. It also emphasizes the point that even agreement and contra-
riety (anvaya and vyatireka), which are the very life of inference,46 TANTRASĀRA
also depend on prasiddhi. Similarly, perception looks for prasid-
dhi as its support; for without its help, which is thought to be of
the nature of self-reflection (svātmavimarśātmika prasiddhi), it
would not be possible to consider anything as acceptable or avoid-
able. Therefore, prasiddhi lies at the root of every worldly transac-
tion. The great Lord, who is all-perfect, with the characteristic of
I-consciousness, and who is omniscient, is the source of all pra-
siddhis. He, the Lord, is adorned with a multitude of prasiddhis
with the form of enjoyment (bhoga) and release (apavarga).
The entire universe is of the nature of consciousness, which is
nothing but reflective nature, and that again is, in essence, sound.
• The reflection (vimarśanam) of objects contained by the universe,
and of the diverse relations of past deeds and their results, is
known as holy texts (śāstra). All the śāstras are not really differ-
ent from the nature of Parameśvara. The holy texts have a single
aim; yet, because of the limiting condition of niyati, people are
: strongly attached to only a portion of them. Therefore, some fol-
low the dual system and others are attached to the nondual. In
the end, the author concludes that a particular āgama should
be resorted to only after it has been shown to produce excellent
results.
Chapter Twenty-Two
This last chapter explains the nature of Kulācara. It should be
noted at the outset that this form of worship is not meant for every-
body, but is only for those who are well advanced, and in whom
the inclination for performing such rituals has grown strong; only
because of this are they entitled to perform this worship of the
divine according to this method.
When a person becomes free from determination (vikalpa) and
is able to attain steadiness in the indeterminate state (nirvikalpa),
only then is one entitled to worship according to kulakrama, for
it is stated in the Tantrāloka that if, during the performance of
this ritual, one thinks of the object of worship as different fromINTRODUCTION 47
himself, he fails to attain either siddhi or mukti. One who has
plunged into the secret of this ritual and follows its course is really
endowed with the highest knowledge. Therefore, Jayaratha writes
in his commentary on Tantrāloka 29:102 that those great souls
who are really free from vikalpas take up this course, as pre-
scribed by the Kula system. Particularly, they follow the course
only to see if their mind, in the presence of allurements, is truly
steady in pure consciousness (samvidadvaite) or not. For this rea-
son, they do not think it immoral to practice in the company of
female partners (duti).
Kula ritual is performed in six different ways, namely: (1).
externally, (2) in śakti, (3) in one's own body, (4) in the unity of
both male and female, (5) in the vital energy, and (6) in conscious-
ness. The worshippers are of two kinds: those who desire enjoy-
ment (siddhis) and those desirous of liberation (mukti). Those
desirous of siddhis should perform kulayāga according to the
methods listed as second, fourth, and fifth, while those who desire
liberation should perform the sixth.
The author gives a short description of each of the methods in
a cryptic way. In the past, the tradition was to be handed down
orally, only to those qualified; therefore, many of the matters are
not very clear to us. Therefore, we prefer to say little about this
secret cult.
H. N. ChakravartyTantrasāra of Abhinavaguptaतन्त्रसारः

तदुभययामलस्फुरितभावविसर्गमयं

Chapter One
May my heart (hrdaya) pulsate in the form of emission
(visarga) embodying the nectar of supreme transcen-
dence by the close union of the pair: Śiva and Śakti
(yāmala). One of the pair is Vimalakalā, the mother
who has taken within herself a new creation (Abhi-
nava) in the form of light, and the other is the father,
Pañcamukha Simhagupta, who is the embodiment of
perfection and is intent on expressing himself in the
fivefold activity.
Exposition: The above benedictory verse hints at a number of
technical terms or concepts commonly used in the doctrine of
Trika Śaivism. In this context, the word heart (hrdaya) indicates
universal bliss (jagadānanda), which unifies everything into an
undivided singularity of consciousness. Its form is an ever-shin-
ing light, knowing neither rising nor setting. Restfulness is its
very nature. The author aspires to attain and realize that heart of
consciousness.
Another technical term found in this verse is yāmala, which is
described as the highest equilibrium, [a union] of both Śiva and
5152 TANTRASĀRA
Śakti. This is a union in which Śiva is neither Śiva nor Śakti, and
Śakti is neither Śakti nor Śiva, but each is the combined union
of both. This union is also known as coitus (samgatta). In the
creative process, [expanding from] this union, all the principles,
known as tattvas, emerge. Throughout this process of creation,
the nondual nature of the absolute equilibrium remains tranquil,
like a waveless ocean. This process of creation is the result of a
slight impulse of creativity, an upsurge in the form of a vibrating
agitation, causing the unity to break. This absolute union (yāmala,
samgațța) remains in its pristine state, even in the process of cre-
ation. During that process of creation, 'It' first shows itself as two
[Śiva and Śakti], expanding outward into three, and then many.
The word kula ordinarily means 'body, but in this context it
refers to the seventeenth kalā, the immortal phase of the moon.
The word visarga is the 'emission of drops' emerging from perfect
sexual union. The drops reflect the colors of [Śiva and Śakti]: one
is white and the other red. It tends to move outside [into the mani-
fested universe] and creates the bodies of all living beings. In the
Tantric doctrine, visarga is stated to be hardhakalā, one-half of
the sound 'ha.' The mother is none but the autonomous energy of
Śiva, with whom she remains inseparably united. The nature of
this autonomous energy, which is beyond all limitations, is 'reflec-
tive awareness' (vimarśa). This verse also indicates that Vima-
lakalā was the name of Abhinava's mother. The father is the five-
faced Śiva [with each face represented by one] of the five śaktis:
consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action. They are the
five outlets through which everything becomes manifest, or in the
luminous imagery Abhinavagupta often employs, through which
the entire universe shines. Each of Śiva's 'faces' is ever-engaged
in performing one of his five functions through these saktis. These
five functions are: creation, maintenance, dissolution, veiling, and
bestowing grace.

According to this system, knowledge is the cause of libera-
tion (mokșa), because it opposes or contradicts ignorance, which
:54 TANTRASĀRA
is the cause of bondage. Ignorance is twofold.¹ One abides in the
intellect (buddhigata), and the other lies in the self (pauruşa). The
one which abides in the intellect is ignorance of the nature of real-
ity (aniścayasvabhāvam) and an erroneous conception of the Self
as non-self (viparitaniścaya). On the other hand, the ignorance
lying in the self (pauruşa) is of the nature of thought-constructs
(vikalpa), characterized by a limited form of the light of con-
sciousness. This type of ignorance is the root cause of worldly
existence. This topic will be discussed in the section dealing with
the nature of impurity (mala). The ignorance abiding in the self
(pauruşa) can be removed by means of initiation and other similar
procedures. However, even initiation in the presence of the igno-
rance characterized by indeterminacy (anadhyavasāya) remains
ineffective. This is because initiation is preceded by a determinate
conviction as to what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected,
and is followed by the purification of the principles (tattvas) and
unification with Śiva. Thus, the attainment of that determinative
knowledge steadily abiding in the plane of the intellect is the prin-
cipal factor. Indeed, this practice uproots the ignorance abiding
in the self (pauruşa), because when consciousness in the form of
vikalpa is practiced, it ultimately terminates in consciousness free
from vikalpa.2
The Self (ātmā) is the light of consciousness (prakāśa) free
from the limitation of thought-constructs (vikalpa), and is the very
nature of Śiva. Therefore, the attainment of the 'right knowledge
of a determinate nature' (samyanniścayātmakam jñānam) regard-
ing all objects in every respect is desirable. The attainment of this
knowledge is preceded by study of the holy texts (śāstras). The holy
texts are authoritative, as they are revealed by the highest Lord
(Parameśvara). The subject matter as enunciated by other scrip-
tures is accepted as distinct, not directly related to the totality of
knowledge, and is proved by arguments not directly related to that
subject matter. Therefore, the knowledge taught in other holy texts
(āgamas) is said to grant liberation only up to a certain extent, butTANTRASĀRA 55
not from all bondage. On the other hand, the holy texts revealed
by the Lord Parameśvara bestow release from all sorts of bondage.
The holy texts (taught by Parameśvara) come in a fivefold stream³
and are divided into groups of ten, eighteen, and sixty-four. The
most perfect among them are the texts named Trika, the quintes-
sence of which is the Mālinīvijaya tantra. The subject matter con-
tained therein is difficult to gather and properly elucidate. Without
the proper ascertainment of the essence of reality, this knowledge
neither possesses the property of liberation nor is instrumental in
granting it. It is only unblemished knowledge that possesses such
a nature. The highest human end has its root in knowledge, which
should be practiced in one's own being. It is for the attainment of
this type of knowledge that I begin writing this text.

The lack of right knowledge (ajñāna) is explained in
the holy texts to be the cause of bondage. It is known
as impurity (mala). At the rise of perfect knowledge
it is uprooted in its entirety. Upon the emergence of
Self-consciousness, at the time when all impurities are
destroyed, release (mokşa) is attained. For this reason,
I shall, with the help of this text, reveal the real nature
of that which is to be known.

Introduction

:
In this world, 'innate nature' (svabhāva)4 is the highest aim to
be attained. This innate nature belonging to all entities is of the
nature of 'light' (prakāśa), as that which is not light cannot be
proved to be this innate nature. Furthermore, that light is only
one [literally translated: 'it is not more than one'], for there is an
absence of existence of any other innate nature in that light which
is different from it. This is because of the non-existence of dif-
ferentiation in that light. Time and space cannot bring or cause
differentiation in it, for they possess that light as their innermost
nature. Therefore, the light is indeed only one, and that light alone
is consciousness. The nature of consciousness is to bring illumina-
tion [manifestation] to all objects. In this regard there is no differ-
ence of opinion among scholars.
This shining of that light is not dependent on anything outside
of itself. The state of being illuminated by another light should
certainly be called dependence, as the state of being illuminatedTANTRASARA 57
depends on others for its illumination. However, in the absence of
any other light, there is only this single and 'autonomous' (svatan-
tra) light. It is precisely because of this independence that this
light is not limited by time, space, or form. Therefore, it is all
pervasive, eternal, and it has characteristics of being omniform,
and at the same time it is devoid of any definite or specific form.6
The freedom belonging to that light is its energy of bliss (ananda),
its relish of delight (camatkāra) is its energy of will, its illumina-
tion is its energy of consciousness, its cognizance is its energy
of knowledge, and its association with all forms is its energy of
activity. In this way, although associated with the above principal
energies, this unlimited light of the nature of Siva remains resting
in its own bliss. Being of this nature, he, in the process of unfold-
ing or manifesting, takes on a limited form because of his freedom.
Therefore, he is designated as atomic (aņu). Then, he manifests
himself as autonomous so that he again shines as that unlimited
light of the nature of Śiva. In this process, he manifests his own
Self by the force of his own power of freedom either with or with-
out 'means' (upāya). If he manifests himself with means, then the
icchā, jñāna, and kriyāśaktis are used as the means. In this way,
the means appear to be threefold and the [state of] absorption
(samāveśa) is then divided into śāmbhava, śākta, and āņava. In
this text, the salient features of the fourfold means (upāya) are
gradually going to be explained. 10

The Self with the body of light is Śiva, [who is] free. He,
by the delightful sport of his power of autonomy, veils
his innate nature and opens up his perfect form again,
either with sequence or without it, or by three distinct
means.58 TANTRASĀRA

Chapter Two
In this chapter we will exclusively deal with anupāya.11
When a person 'keenly touched by energy' (śaktipāta) discerns
by himself thus, after listening to the words of his teacher only
once, then his permanently awakened absorption into the Lord
has taken place without any means (anupāya). In this instance,
reasoning alone (tarka eva) is taken to be a limb of yoga. Other-
wise, how could discernment be possible? If this is the question,
we reply: What can be accomplished by 'means' (upāya) regard-
ing the supreme Lord who is self-manifest and one's own self?
This cannot be the attainment of 'innate nature' (svabhāva), as
innate nature is eternally present; it cannot be the attainment of
the recognition (jñapti) of Parameśvara, as Parameśvara is self-
illuminating; it cannot be the removal of the veils, as the existence
of any veils [in that supreme reality] is impossible; it cannot be
the penetration of one into the other, as the one who is enter-TANTRASARA 59
ing and the one who is entered into are not different from each
other. Then, what could the role of upāya be, as the existence of
anything separate from that reality cannot be proved? Therefore,
the entire universe is a unique consciousness alone, beyond the
mutation of time and limitation of space. Furthermore, this con-
sciousness is unaffected by the "accidental attributes" (upādhi);
it is not restricted by shape and form; it cannot be conveyed by
words; nor be described by the instruments of knowledge. It is the
cause (nimitta) of the very nature of time, down to the instruments
of valid knowledge, manifested by his free will. In essence, it is
an autonomous, condensed bliss, which is "I" myself (aham). In
that innermost core of mine, the universe shines as a reflection.
The absorption related to the supreme Lord, [attained by] one who
discerns with firm conviction in this way, is not dependent on any
means. This kind of person does not need to be restrained by dis-
ciplines, such as taking recourse to sacred syllables, rituals, medi-
tation, and observance of spiritual practices.

The multitude of means (upāya) does not reveal Śiva.
Could the thousand-rayed sun be illuminated by a jar?
That person of broad vision, while discerning thus,
enters immediately into self-manifest Śiva.

Chapter Three
One who is unable to enter the unbroken circle of light, 12 already
explained as the reality of Śiva, [who takes recourse to] view-
ing the power of autonomy (svatantrya)13 as extraneous to him,
experiences the indeterminate (nirvikalpa) absorption belonging
to Bhairava. What follows are the instructions leading to this type
of absorption.
All these multitudes of beings (bhāvas) are merely reflections
in the void of consciousness 14 because they possess the charac-
teristic marks of reflection. These are the characteristic marks of
reflection. That which cannot shine separately, but shines when
merged with others, is known as reflection; for example, the
reflection of the shape or form of the face in a mirror, the reflec-
tion of a taste in saliva, the reflection of a smell in the nose, theTANTRASARA 61
reflection of sexual touch in the organ of pleasure, the reflection
of a sensation of sharp contact by a spear or lance in the inner
organ of touch, or the reflection of an echo in the void. However,
this taste is not the original, 15 and being only the effect of that pri-
mary principle, it is not known to cure diseases, etc. In the same
way, smell and touch are not considered original because in the
absence of the principal subject (guņinah), the existence of smell
and touch could not even be postulated, and more so because they
do not set in motion any series of effects or results. On the other
hand, we cannot say that these two are non-existent, as shaking of
the limbs and emission of semen can be seen. Even a sound is not
original because someone utters it and the approaching of its echo
can be heard.
Thus, just as an echo, etc., appears shining as a reflection,
similarly the universe is reflected in the light of the Lord. Now,
the question can be raised: What is the 'original image' (bimba) of
this reflection? The answer is that there is none. Does this mean
that the reflection of the universe is without cause? Alas! Your
query is then aimed at finding a cause. In that case, what would
be the purpose of verbal reasoning? The cause will indeed be
the Śakti belonging to the Lord, whose other name is 'autonomy'
(svātantrya). This Śakti is the immanence of the Lord because
She is the bearer of the reflection of the universe. This universe is
permeated with consciousness, and this universe is the locus of the
manifestation of that consciousness. That consciousness indeed is
this universe in which it is reflected in the reverse order. There-
fore, the Lord is designated as the bearer of the reflection. Fur-
thermore, the Lord's innate nature, which includes the totality of
immanence, cannot be devoid of reflective awareness (āmarśa),
because the one who is consciousness cannot be devoid of reflec-
tive awareness regarding his own Self. If, however, consciousness
lacks self-awareness (awareness of its own innate nature), then
it would condescend to the level of insentiency (jada).16 Further-
more, self-reflective awareness is not created by convention, but
is experienced as being inseparable from the innate nature of
:62 TANTRASĀRA
consciousness, and impregnated with the 'supreme sound' (para-
nāda).1" This supreme sound reflects all the multitudes of energies
belonging to the Lord, which determine this universe.

The Lord possesses three principal powers, namely, the
supreme (anuttara), will (icchā), and act of unfolding (unmeșa).
These threefold cognitive reflections (parāmarśa) are "a,” “і,”
"u."18 Out of these three main powers, multitudes of power evolve.
Ananda19 "a" rests in anuttara "a,” iśana "i" rests in icchā, while
ūrmi "ū” rests in unmeșa. This (ūrmi) is the initial stage of the
evolution of the energy of activity (kriyā śakti). The first group
of cognitive reflections (parāmarśa), that is, “a," "i," and "u,"
being essentially part of light, are identified with the sun. The
second group of reflective cognitions, that is, “ā," "i,” and “ū,"
being of the nature of repose and predominantly blissful by nature,
are identified with the moon. Up to this point, even the slightest
trace of activity has not entered (into the process of manifestation).
When, however, in the power of will (icchā) and in 'the power of
will to lord over' (īśana), activity enters, then they are called 'the
object of the power of will' (isyamāna) and 'the subject of the
power of will' (īśyamāna). At that stage, activity (karman) divides
66TANTRASARA 63
itself into two: the semivowel "r" when light dominates, and the
semivowel "!" when it is at rest. 20 This is because semivowels "r"
and "!" have the nature of arresting the light. However, (at that
stage of manifestation) 'the object of the power of will' (isyamāṇa)
is not discernable as an external object. If it were discernable it
would be created like an external object would be. However, nei-
ther will (icchā) nor 'the power to lord over' (īśana) are clearly
discernible. For that very reason, "r" and "l" are only semivowels
and not consonants like "r" and "l". Furthermore, this group of
letters, "r,” “ri," "!" and "l," are considered neuter because they
bear shades of both consonants and vowels.

When the expansion of anuttara "a" or ānanda "a" in the
direction of icchā "i,” etc., takes place, then the two syllables "e"
and "o" come into existence. Then again, when these two sylla-
bles, "e" and "o," are closely united (samghatța) with anuttara “a”
and ānanda “ā," then the syllables "ai" and "au" are born. This
indeed is the play of the energy of activity (kriyā śakti), which
:64 TANTRASĀRA
shines in the manifestation of the four syllables, that is, "e," "ai,”
"o," and "au."21 Then, at the end of the development of the power
of action (kriyā śakti), just before entering anuttara, all that
which has been created up to this point takes repose and abides
in the bindu22 (am), which is light alone and the very essence of
knowledge. At that very place where bindu rests in unsurpassed
(anuttara), the "anuttara visarga" is born, which is "ah.” Thus,
the aggregate of sixteen letters, which are seeds (bīja), are said
to be the very nature of all reflective awarenesses (parāmarśa).
The recipients (yoni), which are consonants, are born from that
vi+sarga. From anuttara emerges the "ka" group of letters; from
'will without an object' (icchā) the "ca" group of letters; from
will with an object the "ta" and "ta" groups of letters; and from
unmeśa the "pa" group of letters is born. It is because of being
united with five saktis that the five groups of letters are produced.
It is from this threefold division of the will (icchā) that the semi-
vowels "ya," "ra," and "la": are born, while the semivowel "va" is
born from unmeșa.
The letters "sa," "sa," and "sa" are created from the threefold
division of will (icchā). From visarga, "ha" is born, and the let-
ter "ksa” arises from the union of two consonants: "ha" and "sa."
Thus, the Lord who is supreme (anuttara) becomes the 'Lord of
the group of letters' (Kuleśvara). It is this single kaulikī visarga
śakti 23 of the Lord, which as the flow of vibrating impulse in the
form of reflective cognition (parāmarśa) such as groups of letters,
etc., extends from ānanda to external manifestation and assumes
the form of the external principles (tattvas). Visarga is threefold, 24
that is, āņava, which is the restful state of citta; śākta, character-
ized by the awakening of citta; and śāmvabha, which is the dis-
solution of citta.

Thus, visarga is the power belonging to the Lord capable of
creating the universe. 25 When that reality is cognized as integrated
reflective consciousness, then the Lord alone shines. On the
other hand, if that reality is cognized as being divided into con-
sonants and vowels, then it is known as the 'possessor of power'
(śaktimān) and śakti herself. When that reality is cognized as
eightfold parāmarśa along with cakreśvara (the letter kșa), then
it is divided into nine groups. Furthermore, if one cognizes that
same reality placing the emphasis on each and every individual
parāmarśa, then it is divided into fifty. Finally, when that real-
ity is cognized as existing with possible subtle divisions, then the
number becomes eighty-one.
In reality, reflective cognitions (parāmarśas) are only six.26
However, on account of expansion and contraction they become
twelve and thus nourish the fullness of the Lord, as the possessor
of all the śaktis. All these śaktis of the Lord, being of the nature
of reflecting cognitions, are known as Kālikās, 27 divine goddesses.
These pure reflective cognitions are energies by nature, which on
the level of pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā) appear as vidyā (man-
tra) and vidyeśvara (mantreśvara), as supreme and nonsupreme66 TANTRASĀRA
because of the limitation which was created by the slight emer-
gence of māyā. However, they appear divided into distinctive
groups and function as letters belonging to māyā.
When these syllables finally descend through the stages of
paśyanti, madhyamā, and vaikhari 28 and assume the nature of
external categories, then they take on the role of worldly transac-
tions. Although on this level they are syllables belonging to māyā
and are seen as bodies (that is, devoid of life), when by means of
the aforesaid ingenuity they are enlivened by pure reflective cog-
nitions, 29 which symbolize their very life, then they become invig-
orated. If they become invigorated, then they are capable of giv-
ing liberation and/or enjoyment. When one conceives oneself as
the single resort of all possible reflective cognitions in which the
entire multitudes of principles (tattvas), beings, and regions are
reflected, one attains liberation while living through the absorp-
tion born of sambhu, 30 which is free from determinate knowledge.
For attaining this type of absorption, as in the case of anupaya,
there is no need whatsoever for adopting painful procedures such
as the use of mantras, and other such practices. 31

of the mirror, but the mirror is not aware of them. On
the other hand, supreme consciousness, by means of
continuous flow of its own delight of self-consciousness,
reflects the universe.

Chapter Four
When, for the purpose of attaining one's own innate nature (sva-
bhāva), thought constructs32 are gradually purified, 33 as described
in the previous chapter, the course of meditation (bhāvanā), pre-
ceded by right reasoning, study of appropriate āgama texts, and
instruction by a teacher, becomes essential. It is because of the
power of thought constructs (vikalpa) that living beings wrongly
conceive of themselves34 as bound. A firm conviction (abhimāna)
regarding one's own nature becomes the cause of freedom from
samsāra. When this new vikalpa arises, 35 it neutralizes those
vikalpas which are the cause of bondage. This new vikalpa
becomes the cause of ascent (abhyudaya), enabling one to attain
his or her own innate nature. This is as follows: The supreme
reality is unlimited by nature and consists of an undivided singu-
larity of consciousness. It transcends all the principles of limited
nature which terminate in Śiva. This renders stability to all and is
the vitality of the universe. Through it the universe 'throbs' with
life, and that is "I" (aham). Therefore, I am both transcendent68 TANTRASĀRA
:
and immanent. This kind of conviction, however, does not arise
in those blinded by māyā, because they lack right reasoning (sat-
tarka), etc. Vaisnavas and others are restricted to their own scrip-
tures by the principle of attachment (rāga). For this very reason,
they show no interest in studying superior āgamas in spite of their
being available. In this way, they show jealousy in regard to right
reasoning, right scriptures (āgama), and the correct instruction of
a teacher. As it is said in the Parameśvara Āgama:
All the Vaisnavas, etc., are restricted by their attach-
ment to limited knowledge. They fail to understand
the nature of the supreme reality only because they are
devoid of knowledge emerging from omniscience.

Therefore, only those keenly touched by the energy of Śiva,TANTRASĀRA 69
after following the path of right āgama, etc., purify their vikalpas
and enter the supreme reality. 36 Here a question can be asked: If
this is so, shouldn't the supreme reality also be a form of deter-
minate knowledge (vikalpa)? The answer to this question is,
"certainly not," because determinate knowledge fulfills its purpose
simply by removing the impressions of duality.
The supreme reality is everywhere; it is omniform and self-
manifesting. The forms of determinate knowledge are not capable
of either lending any support to it or refuting it. Right reasoning
(sattarka) spontaneously arises in a person keenly touched by śakti.
It is said that this kind of person is initiated by the Goddesses.
In the case of others, the form of right reasoning arises by
the study of scriptures, and so forth. This topic will be discussed
at length in the section entitled Śaktipātaprakāśana. However, at
this point it will suffice to say that the role of the teacher is to
select an appropriate āgama text for a disciple to study. The role
of agama, on the other hand, is to give rise to the proper type of
vikalpa (śuddha-vikalpa), which is instrumental in generating the
series of homogeneous thoughts free from doubt. This series of
homogeneous determinate thoughts is called right reasoning (sat-
tarka), and this right reasoning is called meditation (bhāvanā).
Through bhāvanā 37 past objects [objects that have gone to rest in
the past] that were indistinct, are now made as if present by ren-
dering them distinct. In this context we can say that no other direct
means but reasoning, which is the light of pure knowledge, can
serve as the limb of yoga. For example, tapas, etc., belonging to
the niyama group, ahimsa, etc., belonging to the yama group, 38
various types of prāṇāyāma, etc., all are finally based in objec-
tive existence. Therefore, what could be their role in regard to
consciousness? Even pratyāhārā 39 only renders excellence on the
level of senses, that is, the instruments of knowledge and action.
In the same way, dhāraņā, dhyāna, and samādhi, if practiced
gradually and in this particular order, could grant to the medita-
tor the identification with the object of his meditation. However,
meditation or practice on the supreme reality, which is identical70 TANTRASĀRA
with Śiva and is one's own innate nature, is not at all possible. The
practice of one who is established in consciousness is the process
of steadily establishing prāņa, intellect, and body in it. This is not
unike carrying a burden, studying the real meaning of śāstras, or
practicing dance. In the case of consciousness, however, nothing
can be added or taken away from it. 40 Therefore, how can practice
(in regard to consciousness) be possible?

होमो जपो व्रतं योग इति,
Now the question arises: "If this is so, then what can be accom-
plished by right reasoning?" We have already answered this ques-
tion by saying that the role of right reasoning is only to remove
the impressions of duality and nothing else whatsoever. As every-
thing is of the nature of consciousness, the main purpose of even
ordinary practice is to create the desired form in the body, prāņa,
etc., and put the undesired form in a subordinated place. How-
ever, it has already been explained that nothing can be taken away
from the supreme reality. Even the impression of duality is not
something different from consciousness. It is merely ignorance
of one's own essential nature. Therefore, it was said that duality
is removed by pure determinate thought (śuddha-vikalpa). The
supreme essential nature has an innermost nature (svabhāva) that
is self-shining, which assumes the state of ignorance through itsTANTRASĀRA 71
own freedom. Then gradually, by forsaking it, it first becomes
intent on blossoming, then it begins to blossom, and finally it
becomes fully blossomed. Thus, by manifesting [literally 'shin-
ing'], following this sequential order, it manifests itself in its full-
ness. This shining is the very nature of the Lord, and for that
reason the limbs of yoga cannot be the direct means. However,
reasoning (tarka) is of great importance here, and right reasoning
(sattarka) alone is the direct means. This right reasoning is pure
cognition (śuddha-vikalpa), which gets purified through differ-
ent means, such as through oblation (yāga), offering of food into
the fire (homa), repetition of mantra (japa), religious observances
(vrata), yoga, etc..

Yaga is offering of all entities to the Lord for the purpose of
attaining firm conviction in the form of the determinate knowl-
edge: "All entities are firmly established in the Lord and there
is nothing separate from him." For those who are spontaneously
enjoyers of penetration into consciousness, it is easy to make this
offering (yāga) to the Lord because it is pleasing to the heart. It is
:72 TANTRASĀRA
:
with this purpose in mind that offerings such as beautiful flowers,
sandal paste, etc., are prescribed to be offered externally. Offer-
ings into consecrated fire (homa) is dissolution of all entities into
the fire of consciousness of the Lord, who takes delight in con-
suming all and making them remain as the flame of fire alone.
Homa is for the purpose of attaining this steady determinate con-
viction: "All entities are made of the light." Repetition of a man-
tra (japa) is for the purpose of enlivening reflective cognitions,
but without being dependent on them existing as knowables either
externally or internally, and appearing as if they are distinct from
the highest reality. This kind of reflective cognition of the highest
reality, which is not different from one's own Self, is called.japa:
Religious observance (vrata) is the perception with firm con-
viction that the body, a jar, etc., are in essence identical with the
Lord. This is for the purpose of attaining the supreme Self con-
sciousness (abhimāna) of the Lord, which is not to be attained by
any other means. As it is said in the Śrīnandiśikhā, "The highest
vow (vrata) is the harmony of all." That supreme reality, which
is independent from all forms of thought constructs, shines forth
through various forms of determinate knowledge which possesses
elements of pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā). Yoga, which is a par-
ticular type of determinate knowledge (vikalpa), and whose nature
is the unification with one's own innate nature, exists for the pur-
pose of establishing one firmly in that ever-shining light.

The essential nature of the great Lord is the 'fullness of his
consciousness' (pūrṇasamvitsvābhava). This fullness of con-
sciousness is his Śakti, 41 which is known as body (kula), capacity
(samarthya), wave (ūrmi), heart (hrdaya), essence (sāra), vibra-
tion (spanda), glory of power (vibhuti), the three-formed goddess
(trīśikā), the cause of kalana (kālī), one who minimizes (karșiņī),
dreadful (candī), speech (vāņī), enjoyment (bhoga), knowledge
(drk), and the superintending deity of lunar phases (nityā). This
Śakti is expressed by these and other appellations based on various
grammatical derivations, which are technical terms used in the
āgamas. Let this Śakti abide in any of these forms in the heart of à
meditator. If this Śakti is viewed collectively, as consisting of the
totality of all śaktis, the fullness of consciousness becomes mani-
fest. The Lord possesses innumerable dynamic energies (śaktis).
What more can we say? The entire universe is his śakti. There-
fore, it is impossible to enumerate all of them in this instruction.
However, the whole universe can be summed up under three main
śaktis. The supreme energy (Śrīparāśakti) of the Lord is that śakti
by means of which this universe, beginning with Śiva and ending
with earth principle (tattva), is born, seen, and manifested by the
Lord in indeterminate consciousness. Śrīparāparāśakti of the Lord
is that śakti by means of which he projects the universe just like
the reflection of an elephant, etc., in a mirror: as different-cum-
nondifferent. The glorious Aparāśakti is that sakti by means of
which he manifests this differentiated universe, in which all these
objects appear as different from one another.

That śakti, by means of which the triad of saktis are born,
that is, embraced (withdrawn) internally into the Lord through the
process of unification (anusandhana), is the glorious Parāśakti.
That sakti (although remaining) Śrīparā is now called Śrīmātrsa-
dbhāva, 42 Kālakarșiņī, 43 etc. Each of those four śaktis, because
of their freedom, shines in threefold manner; that is, creation,
maintenance, and dissolution. In this way, the number increases to
twelve.44 This takes place in the following way:
1. First, consciousness only shapes (kalayati) entities
(bhāva) within.
2. Then it projects (kalayati) them externally as distinct
forms.
3. Then consciousness accepts external objects as something
pleasant and desirable, and then it throws (kalayati) them
internally with the desire to dissolve them within.
4. Next it creates doubt regarding various obstacles in the
process of dissolution, after which it dissolves those obsta-TANTRASARA 75
cles as well.
5. After this, the portion of entity shining as doubt, which is
going to be dissolved, is assimilated (kalayati) within the
self through the process of withdrawal.
6. Then it creates (kalayati) the agent of withdrawal and
realizes it as being his own Self.
7. In the process of creating (kalayati) the agent of with-
drawal, it creates some entities as existing in the form of
impressions (vāsanās) and some others as existing in the
form of consciousness alone.
8. Then it creates the wheel of instruments (of knowledge
and action), preceded by the process of the activity of
manifesting its own nature.
9. Next it shapes (kalayati) the lords of the instruments.
10. Then it creates (kalayati) the limited subject belonging to
the level of māyā.
:
11. After this it creates (kalayati) the knowing subject, who is
intent on abandoning limitations and accepting the blissful
state of consciousness.
12. Next it manifests (kalayati) the fully bloomed form of his
own Self.
Thus, the 'twelve divine Goddesses of consciousness' (dvādaśa
Bhagavatyah) manifest themselves, either to all subjects or only
one, simultaneously or sequentially, either in two or three. They
move in the manner of a circle like a wheel, and also shine exter-
nally in the form of months, and other minute divisions of time,
the signs of zodiac, and finally in the form of pot, cloth, etc. In
this way, they nourish the autonomy of the 'Lord of the Wheel'
(Cakreśvara) and are expressed by the word Śrī Kālī.
The different meanings of the word kalana 45 are: moving,
throwing [projecting], knowledge, enumeration, causing all the
objects to become objects of enjoyment, sounding, and withdraw-
ing [assimilating] the objects into oneself. As it has been stated
by the teacher Śrī Bhūtirāja: "She is known as Kālī on account of
projecting, knowing, and enumerating." The meaning of Kālī can76 TANTRASĀRA
be seen in detail in various places of my Parātrīśikā Vivaraņa and
the monograms of my hymns. It is the tradition of my teachers
that esoteric secrets should not be disclosed in one place, nor is it
proper to keep them totally hidden.

All that has been stated about yāga, homa, and so on, should
be understood to be only for Maheśvara. 46 All perceive those very
things that are to be avoided as those that are to be accepted, and
also perceive everything from Vişņu to Śiva as Paramaśiva. ThisTANTRASĀRA 77
kind of view is wrong and it should be rejected by yogins fol-
lowing the path of the Absolute (anuttarayogins). For this very
purpose, Vidyādhipati has made great effort in his monograms
entitled "AnubhāvaStotra."
Thus, in each of these five, beginning with yāga and ending
with yoga, there are different levels of steadiness to be attained.47
One should act in such a way that one may attain a steady convic-
tion in them. This kind of yogin should not think, "This food is
sanctioned and this food is prohibited, or this is pure and this is
impure," and in this way cause suffering to his own self. Purity,
impurity, etc., are not invariable properties belonging to the
object, but in essence, products of the imagination. Thus, it is
stated in the Śrīpūrva:48 "Purity is not the essential attribute of
an object in the same way as the property of being blue, etc., is
not the essential nature of an object, for it has been stated to be
impure on other occasions." In (the case of) an offering of gifts to
one who has been initiated, if it is argued that because of directive
statement (codana), this offering of gifts is impure with reference
to that (directive statement), then it is similar to some other direc-
tive statement (codanāntara) which may contradict the former, but
such a contradictory directive statement is unreal because of [this]
incongruity-if it is so argued, then we say, "no," that is not right.
The directive statement uttered by Lord Śiva himself is sufficiently
forceful to annul other directive precepts. It is well-supported by
logical reasoning, and also [well-established] in numberless āga-
mas like the Sarvajñānottara and others. We shall speak of it later
in the sequel. Therefore, the rule which is enjoined, in the scrip-
tures, as the precept to be followed and the thing that is to be
prohibited, beginning from the Vedas down to the Tantras of the
Lord as understood by the Siddhāntins, such as Kulocchuşma and
others, serves no purpose in this context; therefore the truth of the
matter is established. In the Śrīpūrva and other texts it has been so
stated. One should seek a detailed account of it in the Tantraloka
and other texts.
Bound souls possess a firm conviction of the follow-78 TANTRASĀRA
ing nature: "I am dull, I am much-enticed by the bonds
of past deeds, I am impure, I am led by others." Upon
perfect attainment of a firm conviction contrary and
distinct from the above, the same bound soul immedi-
ately becomes the Lord (pati) with the immanent form
of pure consciousness.
The perfect yogin should always be mindful that a firm
conviction of the aforesaid nature should be attained.
He should not endanger himself with doubts [arising
from] notions lacking the true nature of things, or by
the unsound precepts of dullards.

Chapter Five
When a discursive thought (vikalpa) is capable of purifying itself
in itself without depending on other means, it loses the function-
ality which is commonly associated with bonded beings (paśu).49
Then, by the grace of pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā), it (vikalpa)
becomes transformed into the energy of the great Lord, and after
taking recourse to it as the 'means' (upāya), it becomes capable
of manifesting the knowledge belonging to sakti (śākta). This pro-
cess was explained in the previous chapter.
When, for the purification of discursive thought (vikalpa), one
needs to rely on the 'means' (upāya), then he or she can take
recourse in the intellect (buddhi), prāņa, body, jar, and other
external objects of a limited nature. 50 By doing this, one descends
to the level of an atom (aņu) and causes the 'knowledge of limited
nature' (āņava) to manifest in his soul. On that level the bud-
dhi possesses a meditative nature, and prāņa is of two kinds:51
gross and subtle. The former is of the nature of moving upward80 TANTRASĀRA
(uccāraṇa). This moving upward possesses five modalities: prāņa,
apāna, samāna, udāna, and vyāna. The subtle form of prāņa is
denoted by the syllabic sound (varņa), which will be explained
later. The body, possessing a specific type of arrangement, is
denoted by the word karana.52 Jars and so forth are external
objects, which will be described as the means for the purpose of
worshipping the altar and the phallic form (linga).
Among all of these means, it is appropriate to give instruc-
tion regarding meditation first. It has already been pointed out
that the self-shining supreme reality exists externally in all the
principles (tattvas). Having meditated on that supreme reality in
the heart of one's own consciousness, 53 one should then meditate
on the close union of the three, which are fire, the sun, and the
moon. In this context, fire stands for the knowing subject, the sun
for the instrument of knowledge, and the moon for the knowable
objects. One should meditate in this way as long as Bhairava's
fire is not manifested by the fanning of the air in the form of
meditation. This fire is to be conceived as being encompassed by
the aforesaid twelve flames of energy, 54 assuming the form of the
"wheel," out of which these energies emerge through one of the
outlets, such as the eyes, and take their repose on the objective
level. While it is resting [on the objective level], one should first
conceive of it as being externally replenished by the moon in the
order of creation. Then, it should be conceived of as being made
manifest by the sun in the order of maintenance. Further, it should
be conceived as being made to dissolve by the all-encompassing
fire of withdrawal. 55 Finally, it should be conceived of as being
merged into transcendence in order to become one with it. In this
way, the "wheel" attains fullness with no difference from objective
existence. Then, one should meditate by means of that "wheel" on
the residual traces that remain from the entities, and should dis-
solve them in a similar fashion. 56 The person who persists with this
practice of meditation attains the firm conviction that the series of
creation, maintenance, and dissolution are in essence nothing but
his own consciousness, which in reality is freedom (svātantrya),TANTRASĀRA 81
shining as creation belonging to one's own innate consciousness. In
this way, one realizes the state of Bhairava without delay. However,
it is only through practice that one attains all sorts of desired goals.
One should meditate in the blissful and luminous abode
of one's heart as the self-manifest, integral unity of the
Self consisting of three, that is, knower, knowledge,
and object of knowledge, having brought them into the
core of his heart.
One should meditate on the Lord, the all-pervading
One, the Lord of the "wheel" presiding over those
twelve powers of its rays, who is emerging outwardly
through the outlets (voids, vyoma), and is the agent of
creation, and so on.
The yogin should meditate on the totality of entities,
both external and internal, which have been dissolved
into the Self and are going to take repose (viśrānti)
therein. Thus, the light of the Self shines forth.

Now, the topic related to the 'upward movement'
(uccāraṇa) of the vital energy (prāņa):
One desirous of moving his vital energy upward (uccāra)
should first make it rest (viśrānti) in the heart, 57 the void, and then
through the rising of prāņa should have it rest in external objects.
Prāņa should rise there while being replenished by the moon of
apāna, by means of which one experiences one's all-inclusive
nature and becomes indifferent to everything distinct from the
Self. With the rise of samāna, balanced energy, one experiences
the state of unification of all objects, which then rest in a state
of repose. Then, with the rise of the fire of udāna, the limit-
:TANTRASĀRA 83
ing distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is dissolved.
With this consuming fire, which devours objects, knower, and
knowledge, and with the subsiding and rising of vyāna, the high-
est knower, free from limitation, becomes manifest. Thus, it is
explained that all the 'stages of rest' (viśrānti) beginning with
void (śūnya) and ending with vyāna, are all different stages of
bliss. They are as follows: nijānanda, nirānanda, parānanda, 60
brahmānanda, 61 mahānanda, 62 and cidānanda.63 Universal bliss
(jagadānanda) is the one blissful state, which unifies all the other
six states mentioned above. This universal bliss is free from rising
and setting, and is repose in one's own Self. One should take rest,
either in two [different] ways or in every respect, on one of the
five prāņas in any of the stages of uccāraņa. By doing this, one is
able to attain the reality of the 'truth of repose' (viśrāntitattvam),
which is different from body, prāņa, and so on. This is indeed the
secret of pronouncing the seed mantras of creation "sa" and dis-
solution "ha." By continued unification of these two syllables one
should purify discursive thoughts (vikalpa).
The above-mentioned 'stages of rest' have five stages, each of
which depends on the comparative proficiency of the practitioner
in absorption. However, if one is well practiced in the above means,
then the 'bliss comes in the beginning' (pragānanda)64 because
of the glimpse of the fullness of the Absolute. As a result of this,
an 'upsurge' (udbhava) takes place for a moment as one gains the
firm conviction that he is free from the body. After this, 'shaking'
(kampa) follows because the conviction that the Self is identical to
the body has been loosened by the overpowering nature of one's
'potentiality' (bala). This is followed by the 'void of sleep' (nidrā)
as the tendency toward externality disappears. In this way, the
notion of the self dissolves in the nonself, and the notion of the
nonself dissolves in the Self because the Self is of the nature of all.
Then the yogin experiences 'great expansion' (mahāvyāpti), hav-
ing 'firmly rooted himself in the truth' (satyapada), upon which a
'whirl' (ghūrņi) takes place. All of these are the stages of the states
of consciousness, which begin with the 'waking state' (jāgrat), 6584 TANTRASĀRA
and end with the state ‘beyond the fourth' (turyātīta).
These stages become manifest when a yogin enters the triangle,
i.e., the 'bulb' (kanda), the heart, and the palate cakras, and the
higher 'coiled state' of śakti (ūrdhvakundalini). That state, where
the 'moving upward' (uccāra) of the vital energy has its repose
(viśrānti), where the entity of knowables has dissolved into a 'tran-
scendent vibration' (paramspandam), where knowables appear in
a budding state, and where they where they have fully blossomed,
[that state] is known as threefold linga. 66 The nature of this three-
fold linga will be described when the occasion for that arises. The
highest linga according to this system is called 'Heart of Yogini'
(Yoginīhṛdaya). Of the above, the principal one is characterized
by vibration. When this vibration expresses itself in the form of
contraction and expansion with the nature of the 'unity of the two'
(yāmala), it attains repose with the form of the 'subtle emission'
(visargakalā). Here, I should stop revealing esoteric secrets. The
entrance into it (samāveśa), however, remains unrevealed.
In the beginning, one remains steadily established in
one's own innate consciousness; then by 'repose in the
object' (prameye viśrāmya), one fills the knowable.
Then he quickly dissolves the distinctions of subjectiv-
ity and objectivity, and takes rest.
Through expansion one experiences repose [(viśrānti)]
on different levels. These levels are six, along with
the void (śūnya), and as such they serve as the means.
Waking and other states remain merged in this fivefold
prāņa, beginning with prāņa and ending with vyāna.
One well established in the above is able to ascend to
(or become established in) the abode of the creation and
dissolution of 'self-awareness' (vimarśa).

Now on the topic of 'syllabic sound' (varna), which is of the
nature of subtle vital energy:
In that 'upward movement' (uccāra) of the vital energy, there
is a sound (dhvani), which is continuously sounding as if it is
imitating the unmanifest.67 This sound is called 'syllabic sound'
(varna). The most important characteristics of this syllable are
the seed mantras of creation "sa" and dissolution "ha." One
can attain supreme consciousness by the practice of these man-
tras. For example, when letters beginning with "ka" and ending
with "ma, "68 either with or without vowels, are merged into the
core of the vital energy or simply brought to memory, then one
experiences a balanced state of vibration of consciousness. This86 TANTRASĀRA
is because the 'word,' that is, mantra, is free from conventional
relations (samaya)69 and therefore is full in every respect. Even
the words which depend on convention are also capable of con-
veying their respective meanings according to the imagination of
one's mind. After one has experienced supreme consciousness [in
this way] he should bring together the heart, the throat, the lips,
and the two 'ends of the twelve' (dvādaśānta). Then, one should
unify all of them in the 'core of consciousness' (hrdayam). This is
the esoteric secret of this syllable (varņa). Some explain that from
the 'reflective consciousness'vibrating in the 'core of the heart'
emerge white- and yellow-colored syllables. It is by this medita-
:tion that a yogin is able to realize consciousness.:
By the vibrating consciousness in absence of any object
to be denoted, and by restraining the movement of
both moon (indu, that is, apāna) and sun (arka, that is,
prāņa), a person, because of entering into the realm of
consciousness in a balanced way, becomes fully perfect
in regard to cit, bīja, and pindamantras.
This is the brief summary in verse of the topics discussed in
this section of Chapter Five. Here ends the elucidation of the way
of the 'syllabic sound' (varņa). Karaņa will be explained in the
mudrā section.
To some, discursive thought (vikalpa) attains fullness
without resorting to any means, and to some it is puri-
fied by taking recourse to means. The expediency in
this system is manifold. It is in the intellect (buddhi),
the vital energy (prāņa) in the body, and in external
objects as well. They have been explained as limited,
but at the attainment of the result, how can there be any
distinction?

Chapter Six
External Practice
This external practice is denoted by the term 'formation of the
place' (sthānaprakalpana). According to this system, the loca-
tion (sthāna) is threefold, i.e., vital air (prāņa),70 the body, and
external objects. 71 The procedure (vidhi) with regard to vital air
(prāņa)72 is as follows: The entire sixfold path, which will be elab-
orated later, is conceived as abiding in the vital air. Time (kāla)
is the sequential and non-sequential unfoldment73 of 'mutative
activity' (kalana). However, it should be understood that time also
exists within the Lord. The manifestation of time is caused by that
śakti belonging to God called Kālī.74 On the other hand, the mani-
:88 TANTRASĀRA
festation of both sequence and non-sequence, which brings about
external differentiation, is the modality of vital air (prāṇavṛtti).
It is indeed consciousness alone which assumes this nature by
isolating itself from the knowable.75 As a result, consciousness
assumes the form of void (nabha), which because of the associa-
tion with limitation assumes the nature of 'knowable object' (ved-
yatām). Then consciousness, being intent on accepting the objects
of knowledge because of its freedom, is as if it were falling from
its original state and becoming predominantly of the nature of
the 'power of activity' (kriyā śakti)." Then the form of vital activ-
ity, which is the very life of living beings, fills the body with five
forms of prāņa. In this way it shines as a living being.
The 'path of time' (kālādva) shines in the early portion of
kriyāśakti, while the 'path of space,' characterized by a diversity
of forms, shines in the later portion of kriyāśakti. The states of
varņa, mantra, and pada abide in the path of time because they
are the supreme, subtle, and gross forms respectively. The state
of the path of space (deśādhva) that is 'principles' (tattvas), the
'worlds' (bhuvanas), and 'subtle elements of the universe' (kalā)
will be explained when the occasion for that arises.
Although the vital air remains interwoven inside and outside
of the body, prāņa moves from the heart by the perceptible effort
of the knowable objects; (that is, taking prāņa as the knowable
object). The three śaktis: 'belonging to the Lord' (prabhu śakti),
'one's own śakti' (ātmā śakti), and 'effort' (yatna) are the causes of
the movement of prāņa. This is accomplished through their rela-
tive dominance and subordination.77
The length of the breath, both the inhalation and exhalation
of all living beings, from Brahmā to an insect, is thirty-six digits
(angulas) if measured by (the length of) their own fingers. 78 This is
because all living beings have the strength, effort, and body befit-
ting them. The entirety of time, that is, the lunar days, months,
years, and number of years, is contained in the movement of the
vital air. One minute (cașaka) is made up of one and one-fifth dig-TANTRASARA 89
its (angula). Following this line of measurement, one hour (ghat
ikā) arises. Therefore, counting the inhalation and exhalation of
the breath, the total becomes seventy-two digits.

Next, the rising of the lunar day (tithi) will be described. One
tuți consists of two and a quarter digits. Four tutis make three
hours (prahara). The duration of both dawn and twilight is half
of a tuți each. Thus the inhalation and exhalation of one breath is
known as the day and night. This is the way of the arising of the
lunar day.

Now the rising of the month will be explained. Here, the day is
the dark fortnight and the night is the bright fortnight.79 The first
half and the last half of the tuți is considered as 'rest' (viśrānti)80
:90 TANTRASĀRA
because it is beyond the influence of time. However, the inter-
mediate fifteen tutis make up one fortnight. There, in these tithis
light and rest occur, which are known as day and night. Day is
when the manifestation of the knowables takes place, and night
is when they dissolve into the knowing subject. 81 Day and night
have infinite divisions because of the variety of prolonged and
temporary duration. The 'equinox' (visuvat) is the occurrence of
the balance of both. During the dark fortnight, the moon, which
stands for vital energy (apāna), offers replenishing lunar phases
(kalā) one after the other to the sun (prāna), until the fifteenth
tuți is reached. This fifteenth tuti is adjacent to the 'end of twelve'
(dvādaśānta), the waning moon from which all the phases have
been separated and thus has become emaciated, i.e., dissolved into
prāņa. The tuți that follows is the conjunction of the half month
(paksa). The first half of that tuți is related to the night of new
moon (amāvāsya) and the latter half to the first day of the lunar
fortnight (pratipad). When the portion related to (amāvāsya)
enters into the portion related to pratipad as a result of a conscious
effort of expelling air, such as a cough, it causes a break in the
length (that is, the flow) of the vital air, usually one tithi in dura-
tion. This is known as an eclipse (specifically, a lunar eclipse). At
that time, rāhu, the knowing subject of māyā, who is insepara-
bly associated with the object of knowledge and who is naturally
incapable of obliterating, but only of veiling [the moon], drinks
the nectar of the moon that abides in the sun (prāna). This is
an auspicious time, capable of bestowing extraordinary results,
because this is a moment in which indivisible unity of the knower,
known, and knowledge takes place. When the prāņa enters the
realm of apāna, consciousness in the form of the sun fills up the
apāna gradually in the form of the moon (offering to it) one lunar
phase after the other. This process continues until the full moon
(pūrnimā), which consists of fifteen tutis, develops. After this,
the conjunction of the half moon and an eclipse takes place as
described previously (solar eclipse). However, this eclipse bestows
only mundane results. This is the rising of the month.TANTRASARA 91

Now the rise of the year will be described. The 'dark fortnight'
(krşņa paksa) is the passage of the sun to its 'northern course'
(uttarāyana). The passage of the sun from one side of the zodiac82
to the other (samkrānti); beginning with Capricorn (makara) and.
ending with Gemini (mithuna), is six digits (angula) in length. The
five lunar phases (tithi) consist of one digit each. In these lunar
phases there is also a division of days and nights.
Thus, when inhalation occurs, that is known as the passage
of the sun to its southern course (dakșināyana): The six changes
found in living beings, i.e., the state called insemination, the will
to become, the desire to be born, the state in which birth becomes
imminent, starting to arise, and real appearance, are all included
in the signs of the zodiac beginning with Capricorn and ending
with Gemini. The other six human conditions, i.e., birth, length
of life (stithi), transformation (pariņati), growth (vrddhi), decay,
and death, are included in the last six signs of the zodiac. For this
reason rituals performed during this particular time (according to
the zodiac) bestow the appropriate results. The rudras, beginning
with Dakșa and ending with Pitāmahā, together with their śaktis
are the superintending deities of the twelve signs of [the] zodiac. 83
Here ends the description of the arising of the year.

If the sixty lunar phases (tithis) are conceived in the breadth
of each finger (angula), then following this method of calcula-
tion, one year is conceived in the passage of the sun from one
sign of the zodiac to the other. Counting in this way, in the in-
going and the outgoing breaths, the raising of twelve years takes
place. 84 When in one digit (angula) the number of lunar phases
is conceived to be three hundred, then one-fifth of a digit makes
one year. 85 Following this method of calculation, what was previ-
ously described as one cașaka, i.e., one and one-fifth digits, then
the period of five years will place in one passage of the sun from
one sign of the zodiac to another (samkrānti). Following this pro-
cedure, the rising of sixty years takes place in a single inhalation
and exhalation of the breath. Therefore, the number of the lunar
phases is 21,600, which is the number of inhalations and exhala-
tions of the breath in the course of one day and night. A number
higher than sixty has not been examined because it borders on
infinity.
Furthermore, one year for human beings is the lunar phase
(tithi) of the gods. 86 Following this procedure, 12,000 heavenly
years composes the four yugas. The duration of these four yugas
is 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 years, beginning with krtayuga.
There are eight junctions between them, which are 400, 300, 200,
and 100 years in length. One manvantara consists of 71 cycles
of these four yugas. Fourteen of these manvantaras make up one
day of Brahmā. At the end of this day of Brahmā, the three worlds94 TANTRASĀRA
are burned up by the 'fire of time' (kāla agni). However, the upper
three worlds88 are overpowered by sleep caused by smoke. The
creatures living there are propelled by the rapidly burning [cos-
mic] fire to a world called Jana and remain there as pralayākala
souls. But those creatures called Kuşmanda, Hațaka, and others
who are properly enlightened souls continue to play in a world
called Mahas. When the period of that night of Brahma is over,
creation starts again. Following this system of measurement, the
life span of Brahmā is one hundred years. This is the duration
of one day and night of Vişņu. His life span is also one hundred
years. The life span of Vişnu is one day in the life of Rudra, the
Lord of the Rudra world, which is above the world of Vişņu. The
duration of his night is of the same length: one year is as described
above. One hundred of these years is the limit of the life of Rudra.
At the end of one hundred years [of his life] he attains identity
with Śiva. The functional period of Rudra is one day consisting
of 'one hundred rudras' (śatarudras), who support the sphere of
Brahmā. Their night is of the same length. Their life span is also
one hundred years long. At the time of the death of the satarudras,
the destruction of Brahma's reign takes place. Thus, the life span
of the rudras abiding in the water principle to the end of the pri-
mordial nature principle (prakrti) is counted in the following way:
The life span of the rudras, abiding in the lower principle, is a day
in the life of those who live in the higher principle.
Then Brahma and Rudra (although their worlds are destroyed,
Brahmā and Rudra are not), who are presiding over water, and
the other tattvas, remain in an unmanifest (avyakta) state. At that
time, Lord Śrīkantha becomes the agent of destruction. This is the
intermediate state of dissolution which ends in avyakta. When
the time of destruction is over, a new creation begins again. At
that time, those who attained liberation by following other śāstras
are also created.90 The span of life of Lord Śrīkantha is one day
of those rudras who abide in the veils (kancukas).91 The length
of their night is the same. One day of Gahaneśa is the life span
of Rudra. The length of his night is the same. During the night of:
TANTRASĀRA 95
Gahaneśa, everything that remains dissolves in māyā. After disso-
lution, Gahaneśa creates again. When the life span of the unmani-
fest state (avyakta) is multiplied by ten parārdhas (one parārdha
is 100,000 billion years), it is said to be the period of one day of
māyā. The same is the case for the length of the night of māyā.
The night of māyā is stated to be a dissolution (pralaya). The time
span of māyā, when multiplied by one hundred parārdha, is one
day of Iśvara. There, the vital energy (prāņa) creates the universe.
The same is true for the length of one night, during which prāņa
takes rest. In the cavity called brahmabila, where the vital energy
stops its function and although consciousness there remains in
a tranquil state, even there this sequence persists. When the life
span of Iśvara is multiplied by one hundred parārdhas, the number
we arrive at amounts to one day of Sadāśiva. The same occurs in
the length of his night. Sadāśiva's night is known as mahāpra-
laya.92 After the end of his period, Sadāśiva encloses bindu,
ardhrachandra, and nirodhikā within himself and dissolves him-
self into nāda. Nāda dissolves into śakti, śakti into vyāpinī, and
vyāpinī into anāśritaśiva. One day of anāśritaśiva is equal to one
day of sakti when multiplied by 10 million parārdhas. Anāśrita
rests in the realm of samanā. This equilibrium of samanā is
known as Brahmā. From this state of equilibrium (the most sub-
tle state of mind), which is beyond mutation, all these aforesaid
'mutations of time' and their dissolutions arise like the cyclic
motion of the 'wheel of time,' similar to the opening and closing
of the eyelids. The procedure of counting is as follows: 1; 10; 10
x 10; 100 x 10; 1,000 x 10; 10,000 x 10; 100,000 x 10; 1,000,000
x 10; 10,000,000 x 10; 100,000,000 x 10; 1,000,000,000 x 10;
10,000,000,000 x 10; 100,000,000,000 x 10; 1,000,000,000,000
x 10; 10,000,000,000,000 x 10; 100,000,000,000,000 x 10;
1,000,000,000,000,000 x 10; 10,000,000,000,000,000 x 10.
These are named eka, daśa, śata, sahasra, ayuta, lakșa, niyuta,
koți, ārbuda, vrnda, kharva, nikharva, padma, śanku, samu-
dra, antya, madhya, parārdha. Thus, the number coming later
is ten times higher than the former. The total of these numbers96 TANTRASĀRA
is eighteen. Thus, numerous creations and dissolutions occur in
one breath, 93 having the characteristic of the great creation. That
breath abides in consciousness, the consciousness in an acciden-
tal attribute (upādhi) (with the characteristics of forms, features,
etc.), which accidental attributes go to rest in the singularity of
consciousness. The vibration (spanda) is nothing but the mani-
festation of consciousness, which appears in the form of the emer-
gence of time. Therefore, this diversity that occurs in dreams and
imagination does not create any contradiction in regard to time.
Just as the emergence of time occurs in the form of prāņa, in the
same way, it occurs even in apāna, which proceeds from the heart
to the end of mūlādhāra. As the six causal agents, that is, Brahmā,
Vişņu, Rudra, Iśa, Sadāśiva, and Anāśritašiva, who appear in
the heart, throat, palate, forehead, randhra, and in the 'end of
twelve' (dvādaśānta), 94 operate in the upper region, in the same
way in apāna, these deities operate in the throat, valve, genera-
tive organ, causing it to contract and expand, and in the 'end of
twelve' (dvādaśānta). They are the superintending deities of boy-
hood, youth, old age, death, rebirth, and liberation.95

Now the rising of time in samāna:
As breath in the form of samāna moves along the ten channels
(nādi) born in the heart, it causes fluids, etc., to flow throughout
the entire body in a balanced way. The samāna, while wandering
along the eight different directions, causes the knowing subject to
imitate the activities of the superintending deities of the quarters.97
While moving upward and downward, it (samāna) goes on mov-
ing along the three channels.98 So it is that on the day of equinox
(vișuvat) it moves externally in the morning along the middle path
for one and one-quarter ghațikās. Then, the number of movements
of the breath being nine hundred, it moves externally for a period:
of two and one-half ghatikās from left to right, again from left
to right, and then from the left. Thus, five occurrences of the
movement of the sun from one side of zodiac (samkrānti) to the
other takes place. With the passage of the sun through five signs
of the zodiac, and after a duration of thirteen and three-quarters
ghațikās, (its) being over the autumnal equinox takes place, and
at mid-day, nine hundred movements of the breath occur. Then,
from there the breath moves from the right to the left, then from
the right to the left, and then right. In this way, the sun passes
through (another) five signs of zodiac. Thus, the number of
breaths is nine hundred for each passage of the sun (samkrānti).
This also occurs during the night. Therefore, during the day and
night of vișuvat (equinox), there are twelve samkrāntis in each.
With the increase and decrease of the duration of the day, the num-
ber of samkrāntis will increase or decrease. Thus, in one breath
of samāna the passage of two years occurs because of the absence
of the meeting of the inhaled and exhaled breath. In this manner,
the passage of twelve years occurs as described before, while in
the breath known as udāna, the movement of breaths occurs up to
the 'end of twelve' (dvādaśānta), where time is characterized as
a vibration. Here again, the same method of calculation should be
followed. On the other hand, in the type of breath (called) vyāna,
which is all-pervasive and free from sequence, the emergence of
time is associated with a subtle surge.98 TANTRASĀRA

Now we will explain the rising of the source of phonemes
(varņa):
During the period of balance in an equinox (visuvat), in the
duration of two halves of prahara (one and a half hours) there
arise the phonemes, [which emerge] in groups (kavarga, etc.).99TANTRASĀRA 99
When the breath for each phoneme becomes 216 internally, it
occurs externally to the extent of thirty-six cașakas. This is the
rising of the phoneme automatically, all by itself, without any
effort. On the other hand, the rising of the mantra with effort is
like applying the force of determination to a single effort. Then
a teacher, while continuing to think a mantra day and night with
the thought of unification, becomes identified with the deity of the
mantra.
The number of rising of mantras is interpreted by the rising of
the movement of breath. When that breath is doubled, the rising
becomes half. Therefore, following the same method; the rising.
occurs with reference to the wheel consisting of 108 divisions, and
the rising of the breath becomes 200. According to this method,
one who is able to rest in the movement of the breath, either gross
or subtle, while the movement of breath becomes attenuated and
when time is consumed in this manner, for that one everything is
experienced as one consciousness which is perfectly full with the
variegated śaktis.
The difference of time is the cause of a distinction of knowl-
edge and not a distinction of a knowable object. It is like the
knowledge of one standing on the mountaintop looking down-
ward. This knowledge, as long as it is existent, is known as 'subtle
moment' (kșana). In the rising of one breath, one thought exists.
This is correct. Otherwise, the knowledge of a thought-construct
(vikalpa) cannot be considered to be one because of its gradual
association with the element of a word. This is the case even with
mātrās 100 (dirgha, pluta), which are also gradual. As it is said
in the Astādhyāyī 1.2.32: “The first pada of the svarita vowel
extending to one-half of the duration of the short vowel is udātta,
while the remaining part is anudātta."
Thus, so long as another vibration does not arise, there is a sin-
gularity of thought. At the time of bringing the mantra consisting
of eighty-one divisions into the realm of memory and by means of
entering different forms of attributes, it remains one with refer-
ence to the determinate thought (vikalpa) of Parameśvara, and the100 TANTRASĀRA
experience free from vikalpa takes place as a result of the absorp-
tion of time. Thus, seeing the entire path of time in the arising of
the breath, counting the diversity of creations and re-absorptions
as innumerable and diverse, and cognizing oneself as the one pos-
sessing the great riches of the Lord, one experiences that he is
already liberated.
Visualizing one's own power of breath, which is nondif-
ferent from one's own consciousness, which transcends
time along with being ever engaged with the wheel of
creation, maintenance and dissolution, one becomes
one with Bhairava, the Lord.

Chapter Seven
The Path of Space
The entire 'path of space' (deśādhva) 101 born of Śakti, which
creates diverse forms, rests in consciousness. This entire path,
through the outlet of consciousness, 102 attains its extreme external
limit in the void (śūnya), intellect, prāņa, and the groups of chan-
nels and subchannels. Then it expands externally in the body and
(all the way) to the extent of the linga, altar, and even the image of
deity, etc.
The knower of the truth of the real nature of the thirty-six
tattvas first dissolves all these paths into the body, [then from]
the body into prāņa, prāņa into intellect, intellect into void, and
finally void into consciousness. In this way, this kind of yogin
becomes permeated with consciousness not dependent on any-
thing external. Then he experiences consciousness as Paramaśiva,
and transcending even that state, he experiences himself as being
immanent as well.103
However, in a lesser way [if one is unable to experience the
fullness of consciousness], one may take up a portion of know-
ables such as Brahmā or Vişņu, the superintending deities of the
sphere of māyā, as the highest. In this way, one should become
well acquainted with the knowledge of prakriyā. As it is said:
"There is no knowledge superior to prakriyā." The following is102 TANTRASĀRA
the scheme of prakriyā: in the path of space, the expansion of the
earth principle (prthivītattva) extends one hundred krors in length.
It is spherical like the egg of Brahmā (Brahmāņda). 104 At the lower
end of that Brahmanda is the 'fire of time' (kālāgni), followed by
hell, the nether worlds, earth, and heaven, which extend to the
world of Brahmā. Outside the egg of Brahmā are the worlds of the
hundred rudras (satarudras). 105 There is no fixed number of Brah-
ma's worlds. The principle called water (jala) is ten times the size
of the earth. In this way, each subsequent principle ending with
egoity (ahaṁkāra) is ten times the size of the previous tattva. 106
These tattvas are: water, fire, air, ākāśa, the five subtle elements
(tanmatras); the five motor organs, the five sense organs, the mind
(manas), and finally the ego (ahamkara). The principle of intel-
lect or buddhi tattva 107 is one hundred times the size of 'egoity'
(ahaṁkāra). The principle of primodial nature, or prakrti, is one
thousand times more extensive than the buddhi. This is the extent
of the sphere of prakrti (prakrti anda). 108. The spheres of prakrti
are also innumerable, just like the spheres of Brahmā.
4
The puruşa principle is ten thousand times larger than the prin-
ciple of prakrti. The principle of 'natural law,' or niyati, is one
hundred thousand times larger than that of purusa. From niyati up
to the principle of limited doership, or kalā, each subsequent prin-
ciple is one hundred thousand times larger than the preceding one.
These principles are 'natural law' (niyati), 'attachment' (rāga),
'impure knowledge' (aśuddhavidyā), 'time' (kāla), and 'limited
doership' (kalā). The māyā principle is ten million times larger
than kalā. This makes up the 'sphere of māyā' (māyāņda). The
principle of 'pure knowledge' (śuddhavidyā) is ten million times
larger than māyā. The īśvara principle is ten million times the size
of śuddhavidyā, while the sadāśiva principle is one billion times
the size of the īśvara principle. The sakti tattva is one billion
times larger than sadāśiva. This is known as the 'sphere of śakti'
(saktianda). As this śakti exists pervading all paths externally and
internally, it is called vyāpini. All these subsequent principles
exist as the sheaths of the prior one. The subsequent one is per-
:TANTRASĀRA 103
vasive and the prior one is pervaded. However, all of the paths,
ending with śakti, are pervaded by Śiva. Furthermore, śivatattva,
being immeasurable, transcends and pervades all six paths. The
Lords of the worlds who exist in the intervening regions of each
principle also have their abode on this earth. Those who died in
these places are offered respective places by the Lords. Then they
lead them from one lower region to the upper one by means of the
procedure of initiation.

The fire of time, Kuşumānda, the Lord of the nether
world, Hāțaka, the cauldron of the earth, Brahmā,
Muni, Lokeśa, and Rudras reside in the intermediate
regions of five spheres (andas). Below Ananta exists
Kapālin, Agni, Yama, Nirști, Bāla, Śīgra, Nidhīśvara,
the Lord of vidyās-Śambhu, and at the end of the head
is Vīrabhadra. These sixteen worlds are included in the
sphere of the earth, and kalā is nivṛtti (which is the ele-
ment that gives birth to the sphere).
These eight are called the Lords of water: Lakulīśa,
Bhārabhūti, Dindī, Āsādhi, Puşkara, Nimeșa, Prabhāsa,
and Sureśa. Bhairava, Kedāra, Mahākāla, Madhyāmra,
Jalpa, Śrīśaila, and Hariścandra are called Guhyāṣṭaka,
the eight secret gods who exist in the principle of fire.

The group of eight highly secret gods is situated in the
principle of air in the instrument of knowledge along
with tanmatras. They are: Bhīma, Indra, Attahāsa,
Vimala, Kanakhala, Nākhala, Kurukşetra, and Gayā.
Sthānu, Suvarņa, Bhadra, Gokarna, Mahālaya, Avi-
mukta, Rudrakoți, and Vastrāpada [this group of] the
pure eight Lords, exist in the principle of the ether
(void).106 TANTRASĀRA
:
Sthūla, Shūleśvara, Sankukarņa, Kālañjara, Mandala-
bhṛt, Mākoța, Duranda and Chagalanda, [these eight]
remain in the principle called ego (ahamkāra).
According to the view of some, however, the subtle ele-
ments and sense organs have their location in the prin-
ciple of ego (ahamkāra).
In the principle called intellect, the group of eight heav-
enly born beings is located, while in prakrti the group
of eight yogas beginning with akrta, etc., is found. 109
These 'worlds of seven groups of eight beings' resting
in the kalā named pratisthā are located in the water
principle and are pervaded up to prakrti. In the puruşa
principle are located 110 the worlds of the eleven rudras
called vāma and so on. The principles of impure vidyā,
kalā, and niyati have two worlds each, 111 while the
principle kāla has three, and the principle māyā has
eight worlds. 112 Thus, from puruṣa to māyā the num-
ber of worlds is twenty-eight. In pure vidyā there are
five worlds, 113 and in the iśvara principle the number [of
worlds] belonging to the Lords of vidyās is eight. In the
principle called sadākhya there are five worlds, while
in the kalā called śāntā there are eighteen worlds. 114
Conceiving all these paths (adhvas) either in the body,
or in the vital energy, or in the intellect, or in the great
void of consciousness as the highest, one attains the
fullness of Bhairava.
Here ends Chapter Seven of the Tantrasara of Abhinavagupta
revealing the nature of the path of space.

Chapter Eight
Whatever has been stated previously regarding the creation of the
worlds is [the result of] the greatness of the Lord's power of free-
dom. The world contains within it myriads of knowers having the
diverse forms of objects for their enjoyment. What permeates all
of these worlds like a 'great.universal' (mahāsāmānya)115 is the
Great Lord (Parameśvara). On the other hand, tattva is the form
abiding in only some [of these worlds] possessing distinctive fea-
tures. For example, the earth principle possesses qualities of bear-
ing, hardness, and grossness. It permeates the entire sphere of
Brahmā, beginning with Kālāgni and ending with Virabhadra, 116
whose regions are superintended by their respective lords.

Now the relation of cause and effect in regard to these prin-
ciples (tattvas) is going to be explained. The causal relation
(kāryakāraṇabhāva) is twofold, i.e., 'absolute' (pāramārthika)
and 'created' (srsta). 117 The causal relation of the absolute nature
is of such extent that the Lord, as the ultimate causal agent, mani-
fests in all forms, beginning with Śiva and ending with earth, as
nondifferent from his own Self, while at the same time he remains
resting in his own Self. The created or 'imagined' (kalpita) causal
relation is created by the will of the Lord and brought to life by
the restrictive power of niyati. The extent of this causal relation
is such that in spite of the presence of the manifestation of regular
priority and posteriority, 118 and even if some other features are
present externally, the continuity of the innate nature (svarūpa)
remains invariably present. 119 Therefore, a sprout is created by
the will of a yogin as well as from a seed. In a dream one creates
a jar, etc. Even there the agenthood of the Lord cannot be denied.
Therefore, although the created or imagined causal relation is also
present, the existence of the absolute causal relation is undeniable.
All of this, which was described (potter, clay, which constitute
supposed causal relation) becomes possible only if the Absolute,
as the foundation, remains steadily established and not otherwise.
Therefore, it is proper to say that the causal relation is the totality
of all causes. This totality of causes consists of all beings having
been woven together by the greatness of the knowing conscious-
ness, which possesses absolute freedom. 120
This power of the Lord assumes the nature of a particularTANTRASĀRA 109
group of entities conditioned by space and time. Each individual,
at the time of its creation, assumes such a nature. Although being
of this nature, these entities assume distinctive forms; it is because
they become associated with exterior factors that they change
and attain comparative distinctions. 121 Thus, the very nature of
the great Lord is consciousness and independent freedom of will.
This Lord, who possesses the entire universe consisting of the
multitude of beings as his body, is the creator of the jar, etc. This
is because the consciousness belonging to the potter is not differ-
ent from that Lord; furthermore, the body of the potter is also
included in the totality of objective existence. Then, how can it be
possible for the potter to have any sense of egoism in this regard?
The answer to this question will be that the sense of egoism of the
potter is also created by the Lord, just as is the pot, etc. Even the
:
theory of the totality of causes to propel agenthood [to produce an
effect] in reality belongs to the consciousness which is the imma-
nence of the Lord. Though Mount Meru exists in some distinct
place, it cannot be supposed to be the cause of this particular
jar. 122 Thus, on this topic of the created or imagined effects of the
principle of causal relation in regard to the principles (tattvas),
there are diverse views found in the śāstras. All these different
views are relevant; 123 as for example, the birth of a scorpion can
take place from cow dung, worm, by the will of the yogin, by the
application of mantras, and by the usage of various medicines.
However, we will explain this created or imagined principle of
causal relation according to the understanding of our scriptures.

It has already been explained that the Lord's perfection con-
sists in him possessing five powers (śaktis). While the Lord is
manifesting any [one] of his individual śaktis, his principal Śakti
remains shining in five different ways. When the power of con-
sciousness (cit) becomes predominant, it is called Śiva princi-
ple (tattva). Similarly, when [the power of] bliss (ānandaśakti)
becomes predominant, this is known as the sakti principle (tat-
tva). When, on the other hand, [the power of] will (icchāśakti)
becomes predominant, this is the sadāśiva principle. It is because
of the dominance of the [power of] will that a balanced state
of jñāna and kriyā exists in the sadāśiva principle. When the
[power of] knowledge (jñānaśakti) becomes dominant, this is
the īśvara principle, and when the power of action (kriyāśakti)
becomes dominant, this principle is known as pure knowledgeTANTRASARA 111
(śuddhavidyā).124 The lords of these principles are Śiva, Śakti,
Sadāśiva, Īśvara, and Ananta. The lord of nivṛttikalā is indeed
Brahmā, etc. These lords are of the nature of universal, and indi-
viduals [living beings in these worlds] closely follow these lords.
They are also of five types, i.e., belonging to Śiva (Śāmbhava),
belonging to śakti (śākta), mantramaheśvara, mantreśvara,
and mantras. 125 These five principles belong to the pure path
(śuddhādhva). Up to this extent, i.e., from Śiva to śuddhavidyā,
Śiva is the direct creator. 126 The impure path (aśuddhādhva) is
created by Lord Ananta, whose other name is Aghoreśa. This is
the will of the Lord, and the creation is for the benefit of limited
knowing subjects who are longing for the experience as they have
been agitated in this way. Here, the word 'longing' (lolikā) stands
for the vibrative longing that is of the nature of conceiving oneself
as not being complete. This is only 'desiring' without any object in
sight, that is to say, a feeling of the deservedness to remain limited
in the future. This 'defilement' (mala) is not a separate category
belonging to the soul (puruṣa). The rāga principle, on the other
hand, is desire conditioned by objectivity. However, here in māyā
principle an object is merely an object [e.g., let me have something,
without having any clear idea of what kind of object is desired].
On the other hand, the attachment (rāga) [that] is a property of
buddhi is diversified into different kinds of objective aims. The
difference between the two will be explained later. These 'defile-
ments, āņava, kārma, and māyīya, arise as a result of the will of
the Lord to conceal his own Self and is not a separate entity. 127 It is
because of the will of the Lord that the earth and other principles
possess distinct reality.
This defilement (mala), existing in the vijñānākala souls, is
intent on being destroyed, and for this reason it does not cause ful-
fillment of any objective accomplishment. 128 The mala belonging
to pralayākala souls indeed remains in the process of blooming or
opening up. There the kārma mala, being helped by āņavamala,
becomes the cause of the diversity of worldly existence. Thus,
it was rightly stated that the revered Lord Aghoreśa creates [an:
112 TANTRASĀRA
impure path] for the purpose of enjoyment by limited souls who
are permeated with latent desires for that enjoyment. The agita-
tion (praksobha) of the mala is the result of the forceful impact of
the Lord's will, as insentient beings are incapable of acting at any
level of creation. The shining of sentiency and insentiency is only
with regard to limited souls. The nature of sentiency or conscious-
ness is indeed 'lordship' (aiśvarya), while absence of conscious-
ness, or insentiency, is its defilement. In the process of creating
māyā, both sentiency and insentiency turn out to be of the nature
of the will of the Lord; therefore, it is also eternal. The nature of
the substance to be created will be manifested to appear as insen-
tient. Therefore it is created as such and as it has the characteristic
of spreading through all the created objects. This all-pervading
principle is named māyā. This māyā is the material cause, while
the power which manifests it is called māyāśakti. This māyāśakti
belongs to the great Lord and is distinct from māyā principle (tat-
tva) itself.
एवं कलादितत्त्वानां धरान्तानामपि द्वैरूप्यं निरूप्यम् । अत्र च द्वैरूप्ये

Now the twofold character of the principles (tattva) from kalā
down to the earth will be investigated. The evidence regarding
this twofold nature of principles has been given by Abhinavagup-
ta's teachers in the following way: Whatever shines in an idea
(samkalpa) [as being nondifferent from it], that also shines exter-
nally as distinct, like a jar, possessing a clearly manifested phy-
sical form. The same method applies to the māyā and kalā prin-
ciples, as well as a 'sky flower.' Therefore the logical reasoning
called 'positive argument alone' (kevalānvayin) is applicable here.TANTRASĀRA 113
Those who attain direct experiential knowledge regarding this
dual nature of māyā, kalā, prakṛti, and buddhi are also 'perfected
beings' (siddhas). In this way the twofold nature of māyā has been
proven. This being so, it is from the māyā principle that the emer-
gence of this universe takes place. Although the emergence of this
universe takes place without succession, on the level of imagined
causal relation the sequence appears to occur.

Now the emergence of the universe is being elaborated. In this
system, the function of 'limited doership' (kalā) and the other
'veils' (kañcukas) is considered different with regard to every indi-
vidual. This is because the effect of kalā, etc., in the form of
promoting doership, is perceived as being different in regard to
each individual. These 'veils' (kañcukas) sometimes, as a result:
114 TANTRASĀRA
of the will of the Lord, become unified and become like the indi-
vidual selves as aesthetes. Kala and the other kañcukas are pure
when they perform their own functions [which are] congenial to
the great Lord, because their sole objective is the attainment of
one's own nature as they stand as the opposite of duality. The
kañcukas assume that nature because of the force of the descent
of power [(śaktipāta)]. How this takes place will be clarified when
the topic of descent of power is discussed. However, the impure
[form of five kañcukas] is the opposite of this. Kalā is born from
māyā, which unites the limited self, existing in a state similar
to deep slumber, with limited doership (kimcitkartrtvam). 129 This
kalā is, as it were, the swelling of the seed of the world. Although
kalā is born from the unity of māyā and the limited self (aņu), it
causes māyā to undergo change, but it does not create any change
in the limited self (puruşa), which is changeless. Thus, the indis-
cernible distinction between the limited self (puruşa) and kalā
cannot be easily noticed because of their mutual interpenetration.
However, by the grace of a certain person endowed with lordship,
abiding as a superintending deity in the womb of māyā, all the
impurities of past deeds are destroyed and the discerning knowl-
edge between māyā and puruşa takes place. As a result, a dis-
cerning soul exists as a vijñānākalā soul above māyā and not in
any way below māyā. One who attains discriminative knowledge
between kalā and puruṣa remains above kalā. Similarly, one who
attains perfection in this discriminative knowledge between puru-
șa and prakrti does not transmigrate in the worlds below prakṛti.
However, this discriminative knowledge between āņavamala and
purușa leads to the state of resemblance of Śiva. With full real-
ization of the fullness of purușa one attains Śivahood. Thus, it is
the kalā principle which is the bestower of limited doership, but
this doership is meaningless to a person who is devoid of knowl-
edge. Impure knowledge (vidyā) which gives limited knowledge
is born of kalā. That vidyā perceiving the intellect and abiding
there through discrimination experiences pleasure, etc. The intel-
lect, being of the nature of the three gunas, is incapable of com-TANTRASĀRA 115
prehending the reflected images [in itself] with discrimination. It
is for this very reason that the images reflected in the buddhi are
discerned through knowledge (vidyā).

:116 TANTRASĀRA
Limited doership (kiñcitkartṛtvam) exists for the purpose of
establishing a portion of the attribute known as 'limited' (kiñcit),
which fulfills its purpose [in regard to a particular object] by
implying, 'in some place' (kvacit). This rāga principle has its
function in regard to a particular object. It should not be under-
stood that doership is due to the activity of non-attachment. Even
a person who does not possess non-attachment is sometimes seen
to be free from attachment. On the other hand, a person who
possesses the quality of non-attachment is sometimes seen to be
attached, as, for example, when performing meritorious deeds.
Furthermore, a person who becomes fulfilled by eating good food,
etc., might be free from attachment; however, in this instance,.
latent impressions of attachment cannot be denied. Otherwise, in
the absence of this (a latent impression), the logical inconsistency
of the rising of non-attachment could occur. The principle of time
(kālatattva), on the other hand, by causing limitation in regard to
effect, imposes a limitation on doership as well. The limitation
of a particular object is common to both time (kāla) and niyati.
The function of the niyati principle is to restrict or limit doership
only to an object at hand. The function of niyati is also present
in regard to causal relation. 130 In this way, the group of four veils
(kañcukas) has been created. Only this much is the function of
māyā; limited doership is the function of kalā; (governing) the
present moment (adhunā) is the function of kāla; knowing (jñāna)
is the function of vidyā; being attached (abhiṣvakta) is the func-
tion of rāga; and "I am doing" (karomi) is the function of niyati.
When consciousness functions in this way, abiding in a subtle
body, then it is called a bound soul (paśu). This group of six,
beginning with māyā, is also called six veils (kañcukas). At this
stage, the innate nature of consciousness has been pushed into the
background and hidden, because kāla, etc., become dominant and
exist as veils, covering the innate nature of the Self. It has already
been said that agency, capable of doing only little, is the result
of māyā. In this condition, the agency attributed to the limited
(kiñcit) [agent] is the qualified subject. Kalā, which is functioningTANTRASĀRA 117
there (kartrtvam), is the cause of emergence of vidyā, etc. This
has already been explained.
Now the portion of the qualifying, which has been named 'lim-
ited' (kiñcit), becomes the object to be known and affected. 131 That
very kalā which differentiates jñāna and kriyā from itself is the
creator of the principle prakrti. This prakrti, which is also called
the state of equilibrium of guņas characterized by pleasure, pain,
and delusion, threads through specific types of objects and like
universal abides in them all. In this way, the creation of both pairs,
i.e., the enjoying subject (aņu, purusa) and enjoyable objects,
takes place under the control of kalā. It has already been stated
that their creation in reality occurs without any sequence. How-
ever, it must be pointed out that (for all practical purposes) succes-
sion exists here. The order of sequence regarding vidyā and rāga
is seen differently; for some, being attached, come to know, while
others who know, become attached, etc. In the Tantras, such as
Raurava, etc., the sequential order is different. However, it should
not be understood that there is any contradiction between the two.
:
Prakrti is the generic form of an object of enjoyment, while
the guņa principle is that which abides in the state of agitation.132
Pleasure (sukha) is sattva in nature, which is the illuminating light
manifesting the enjoyable nature of an object. Pain is character-
ized by the oscillation of light and absence of it. For this reason,
rajas is of the nature of activity. Delusion or moha is total absence
of light, that is to say, it is darkness (tamas). These three, sattva,
rajas, and tamas, make up the objects of enjoyment. Thus it is
clear that the evolutes of prakrti come out of an agitated primodial
nature (pradhāna) and not from an unagitated one. It is necessary
to admit the existence of agitation vibration as an intermediate
state between primodial nature and guņas. In this way, the exis-
tence of a separate principle unknown to the Samkhya called guņa
has been proved. 133 The agitation of prakrti takes place only as the
result of the intervention of the superintending deity of prakrti.134
Otherwise, if this agitation in prakrti is not caused by intervention
of the superintending deity, then it would be impossible for prakrti118 TANTRASĀRA
to be involved with each individual puruṣa. Then, the principle of
intellect comes from the guna principle, where the reflection of
the light of purușa and the reflection of objects take place.

Then, from the intellect emerges the egoity (ahaṁkāra) prin-
ciple, by means of which an erroneous notion of non-self as Self
is conceived. This takes place when the light of purusa, which
has become tainted by contact with a knowable object, reflects
on the screen of the intellect (buddhi). This (notion of egoity as
one's true nature) is the erroneous notion, just like mistaking
mother-of-pearl for silver. Therefore, the word aham is suffixed
with kāra, the active agent. This suffix also indicates that some-
thing has been created. The followers of the Samkhya school, on
the other hand, do not accept the self-reflective nature of the Self.
We, on the other hand, assign it the status of agent. Thus, the
agency (kartrtvam) regarding aham is in essence pure reflective
consciousness having none to oppose it (apratiyogi). It relishes
its own bliss as 'I' (aham). This is an aspect of instrumental-
ity belonging to ahaṁkāra. 135 But the other aspect belonging to120 TANTRASĀRA
ahaṁkāra is its being the originator of the ten sense organs, five
tanmātras, and the mind, because it has a threefold nature, which
is the result of its division into sattva, etc. While the mind is being
created, 136 it is conceived of as the originator and is endowed with
the capacity of giving birth to five tanmatras. In regard to the
ear, the mind is endowed with the capacity of giving birth to the
particular subtle element called sound. Furthermore, in regard to
the olfactory sense organ, it is endowed with the capacity of giving
birth to the subtle element called smell. It is not feasible to consider
sense organs as being born of matter. 137 This is because in concepts
such as "I hear," the sense of egoity still persists; for this very rea-
son it is said: the sense organs are born of egoity (ahaṁkāra). It
(the sense organ) remains in contact with that portion of the egoity
(ahaṁkāra); otherwise, if use is made of other intermediate organs,
the defect of infinite regress would take place.
Egoity (ahaṁkāra) is indeed the subject portion of the agent.
Therefore, puruşa possesses two main instruments. Limited
knowledge (aśuddhavidyā) and limited agency (kalā) serve as
instruments of puruşa in regard to knowledge and action, respec-
tively. It is for this reason that lame or blind persons experience
no absence of knowledge and activity which are characterized by
egoity. It is from the sattvika aspect of ahaṁkāra, attributed by
the augmented portion of the subtle elements (udriktatanmātra-
bhāga), that five motor elements emerge. It is because of egoity
(ahaṁkāra) that the organ of locomotion of a person possessed of
egoity is capable of performing its function with a thought such
as "I am going." The principal locus of locomotion, i.e., the foot,
exists externally; however, locomotion exists equally in other
places as well. It is for this very reason that a person bereft of feet
is not completely devoid of ability to move. Furthermore, the mix-
ture of various actions performed by different motor organs should
not be brought into doubt because of the reasons stated before,
that is, because of the existence of a single cause in the form of
ahaṁkāra related to the subject.
Action is performed by organs; e.g., movement possesses activ-:
TANTRASĀRA 121
ity as its principal nature. This, however, is not the case regard-
ing the perception of color, form, etc. According to the Vaiśeşika
school, form, color, etc., is understood to be a property (guņa);
therefore, the group of motor organs is fivefold because it is aimed
at that particular number. For example, for the ascertainment of
activity, externally some motor organs exist for the purpose of giv-
ing or excreting, and others for the purpose of accepting or taking
in, or for both. Or, they may be free from both, or may be for the
purpose of repose in one's own nature. These motor organs are in
the following order: anus, hands, feet, and sexual organs. When
the ascertainment of activity, which remains interwoven with the:
vital air (prāņa) takes place, then this is the function of the organ
of speech. Therefore, it should be understood that the movement
present in the hands, which is the locus of that particular motor
organ, is the same movement present in the feet. It is for this very
reason that an infinite number of activities does not lead to an infi-
nite number of actions.
Some argue that up to this extent the rajas portion of
ahaṁkāra remains involved in the process of creation. Others say
that the mind emerges from rajas; yet others maintain that mind
is the product of the sattva aspect of ahaṁkāra, while the senses
are said to be the product of rajas. The five subtle elements (tan-
mātras) as well as five gross elements, which are nothing but the
knowable objects, are born from the predominantly tamasic and
delusive aspect of ahaṁkāra which veils the agency of the enjoy-
ing [experiencing] subject.
All individual sounds have in their background a single, unspe-
cific and generic sound that precedes them, which is free from
agitation (kșobha). This form of sound is the subtle element of
sound called śabdatanmātra. The same holds true regarding smell,
taste, touch, and sight. From the vibrating subtle element of sound
emerges ether (ākāśa), which provides space to all because it is
capable of allotting space to the objects spoken of, so that they
can occupy their particular places. Air emerges from the agitated
subtle elements of sound, but air is not separate from the element122 TANTRASĀRA
:
of ether (ākāśa). Fire emerges from the agitated subtle element
form (rūpa), while the properties of sound and touch remain pres-
ent in it. From the agitated subtle element of taste water is born,
while the three properties of sound, tactility, and form remain
present there. The earth emerges from the agitated subtle element
of smell, while the four previously mentioned properties remain
in it. Others hold a view that from the agitated sound and touch air
is born, and when all five subtle elements are agitated the earth
is born. The earth is nothing but the aggregate of all properties;
however, there is nothing else that exists which is the substratum
of all properties. In this collection of principles (tattva), the qual-
ity (guna) [belonging to these principles] which is above the lower
one is more pervasive, while the lower one is less pervasive than
the upper one. The excellence of the quality (guņa) can be defined
as that without which other qualities cannot come into existence.
Therefore, the principle of earth is pervaded by all the principles
beginning with Śiva and ending with water. In the same way, the
water principle is pervaded by the fire principle, etc. The same
takes place up to and including the sakti principle.
The gross elements, the host of subtle elements, the
sense and motor organs, prakrti, puruşa veiled with
sheaths, and also from vidyā to the śakti, all of these
are nothing but the order of expansion of the waves in
the form of one's own consciousness.

Chapter Nine
In this chapter, the distinct features of the principles (tattvas)
are going to be examined. 138 In the Trika doctrine, the supreme
Lord himself has taught the existence of the sevenfold variation
of the principles: sivas, mantramaheśvaras, mantreśas, mantras,
vijñānākalas, pralayakalas, and sakalas. 139 Thus, there are seven
possessors of sśaktis (śaktimān). They possess only seven śaktis.
It is because of these variations of the principles, beginning with
earth and ending in pradhāna, that there is a fourteenfold division
of each. 140 When 'unique nature' (svarūpa) is added to this division,
then the division becomes fifteenfold. 141 Among them, the unique
nature, which rests in itself, deserves to come under the purview of
the knowable objects (prameyatāyogya).142 This can only be cog-
nized by the grace of the goddess Aparā. On the other hand, the
subject in whom the energies (śaktis) are overflowing and who
becomes the place of repose for the objects, is the very nature of
that which belongs to śakti (śākta). This can only be known by the
grace of the venerable goddess Parāpara. The sākta form is sev-
enfold because it was stated earlier that number of śaktis is seven.
When the subject possessing the śaktis (śaktiman) becomes pre-
dominant with reference to the host of knowing subjects and [the
objects] rest in the knowing subjects, then it [the knowing subject]
is of the nature of Śiva, the possessor of the śaktis (śaktimān).143
This becomes manifest by the grace of the venerable goddess Parā.
That also is sevenfold because the number of knowing subjects
beginning with Śiva and ending with sakala is stated to be seven.

It is because of this variation of the saktis that the number of
knowing subjects is divided into seven. In order to clarify this, it
is stated in this particular order, i.e., sakala, etc. Sakala subjects
have vidyā and kalā as their saktis. 144 The saktis that function
in the inner senses and motor organs are only particular forms
of these two: vidyā and kalā. In the case of pralayākala souls,
vidyā and kalā remain indistinct145 because they are devoid of
objects. In vijñānākala souls, vidyā and kalā are going to be dis-
solved, but still persist aided by [their] residual traces. In mantra
souls, śuddhavidyā is in the process of awakening. In lords of the
mantra (mantresa) souls, śuddhavidyā becomes fully awakened
when the total absence of any residual trace occurs. In the case
of mantramaheśvara souls, śuddhavidyā is eager to assume the
form of icchāśakti, whose innermost nature is svātantrya. With
reference to Śiva souls, śuddhavidyā, which is of the nature of
will, clearly assumes the manifest form of freedom (svātantrya).
Here ends the description of the seven principal variations of the
śaktis. 146 The knowing subjects possessed by these śaktis are col-
ored by them, and because of this a distinction among them arises.
It is because of the difference of the instruments that a distinctionTANTRASĀRA 125
of agency is created. 147 Śakti alone, which is inseparable from the
agent, can be made an instrument and not anything else. Other-
wise, the fallacy of infinite regress would occur. In reality, there
is only one single knowing subject resting in bliss and freedom.
When the earth is known in its own innate nature, at that time
her innate nature alone shines; for example: "I know the object
that has been seen and experienced by Chaitra." In this experience,
which is perceived by the powers of the sakala soul and by the one
who is the possessor of all the saktis, another innate nature defi-
nitely shines. This statement applies to all the knowing subjects up
to Śiva: "I know the universe," which steadily abides in the unity
of Śiva and Śakti, when viewed with reference to both, and which
later takes its repose in Śiva because of the existence of a specific
concept.

Now the question arises: If an entity does possess the quality
of being cognizable or perceptible (vedyatā) as its own form, then
it would be knowable to all. 148 The quality of being cognizable
would itself also be knowable; this would involve the fault of infi-
nite regress. Then the universe, although fully manifest; would
be blind and in deep slumber because it would involve the fallacy
of association with two contradictory attributes: the capacity to
be cognized and the quality opposite to it (viruddhadharmayoga).
That question is answered in the following way: the capacity to
be cognized (vedyatvā) does not belong to the knowable object
as its very self because the capacity to be cognized, belonging to
the unique nature (svarūpa) [of an object], has been stated to be
something different. That which first takes its repose in the energy
(sakti) of the subject, and then in the subject itself, is indeed
the sharer of restfulness. That sharer of restfulness is indeed
the innate nature [of any given object]. That innermost nature
is indeed self-luminous and it shines with reference to none.149
Therefore, the question of omniscience, infinite regress, and con-
tradiction between two opposing attributes has been refuted.
That very innermost nature (svarūpa) remains one, even when
cognized by countless limited knowing subjects. Its character
is of this singular nature because all these cognitions are of the
nature of manifestation (ābhāsa). Therefore, there is no hindrance
regarding the rising of perceptions and inferences among dif-
ferent subjects. Its character is real because it has the capacity
to serve in worldly transactions; for example, seeing a beautiful
woman watched by others, one experiences jealousy. 150 Also, whileTANTRASĀRA 127
conceiving Śiva as the abode of rest, one experiences absorption.
Seeing an object in which a great number of subjects have been
immersed, one experiences fullness. It is like watching the dance
of a young woman, 151 or seeing 'blue' with its unique character-
istics when it becomes merged with the subject. In this way, self-
reflecting consciousness arises. Thus, everything beginning with
earth and ending with prakrti is of the nature of fifteen. This is
because of the fact that in sakala souls, rāga and the other veils
(kañcukas) have become active, and because it is the sakala souls
who are the experiencing subjects. A sakala soul has this form of
fifteen characteristics because it also comes under the dominion
of 'knowable [objeets]. This topic has been dealt with at length in
the Tantraloka.
From the puruṣa152 to kalā tattvas, these divisions are thirteen.
Since a sakala soul is not associated with subjectivity, the two
characteristics, sakti and the possessor of śakti, do not arise. In
this case, the sakala soul exists merely as the innermost nature
(svarūpa). When the pralayākala soul is the innermost nature and
the remaining subjects are five [in number], then the distinctions
become eleven. When, on the other hand, the vijñānākala [soul] is
the innermost nature, and subjects are four, then the variations are
nine. In the case when the mantra [soul] is the innermost nature,
and the subjects are three, then the variations are seven. When the
mantresa is the innermost nature, and the subjects are two, then
the variations are five. When the mantramaheśvara [soul] is the
innermost nature, and the single Lord is subject, the variations
become three, because of the distinction of sakti and the possessor
of sakti. In the case of Śiva, who is solely of the nature of light,
consciousness, and freedom, there is no variation, because He is
perfect in every aspect. These distinctive variations of the catego-
ries were given in the text titled Parameśvarānuttaranaya. These
distinctive variations of the categories are responsible for the
great variety of worlds (bhuvanas). This is expressed only because
the nether world, heaven, and those worlds belonging to rudras,
though similar, being constituted of earth, yet have differences in128 TANTRASĀRA
their natures due to comparative remoteness. One curious to know
about the subsidiary variations of each of the many enumerations
should try to understand it by studying the Tantrāloka.

Thus, by following the [example of] one single clay jar, the
distinctive variations of earth principle and the other categories
have been examined. 153 Now an exposition of the entire category
of earth with its characteristics of subject and object of knowledge
will be given. That light which shines as nondifferent from the
earth is Śiva; as it is said in the Vedas: "The earth itself is Brah-
man." He who is the Lord of the mantreśvara [knowing subjects
who represent the earth principle] sends those who are the givers
of siddhis, and those who are thus sent are mantreśvaras. The
mantra [knowing subject] is one who is the embodiment of ego-
ism, which assumes the form signified by the term mantra. The
vijñānākala [knowing subject], related to the earth [principle],
is one who has rid himself of samkhya, and other systems fol-
lowed by bound souls, and practiced pārthivayoga by means of
śaivavidyā, but was unable to attain the permanent state. 154 How-
ever, there are those who, at the end of the kalpa or after death,
experience release from the earth as dharāpralayakevalas155 by
means of pārthivayoga, described in the text of paśus. To them,
the earth remains dissolved. However, in the state of deep sleepTANTRASĀRA 129
there is a possibility of the arising of strange and different kinds of
dreams as a result of the overpowering nature of the tattvas. The
person who identifies himself with the earth [principle] is called a
dharāsakala. Even in the state of being a dharāsakala, because of
the prominence of sakti and because of its subordination, the vari-
ety is fourteenfold.156 Thus, these are the variations of the earth
[principle], which have taken the role of the subject. Their innate
nature (svarūpa) is the pure knowable object (śuddhaprameya). 157
The same applies to the other principles.

Now, the variations of the tattvas as they abide in the vital
energy with reference to one perceiving subject will be exam-
ined. 158 In this world, any given person perceiving 'blue' possesses
[his own] vital energy consisting of sixteen tutis (tuțișodaśakātmā).
This vital energy extends up to the end of the knowable objects,
taking possession of the thing known. The first tuti is free from
any division and remains an undivided unity. The second is of the
form of a knowing subject who is about to come forth [into mani-
festation]. The last is identical with the object to be known, while
the penultimate one is the manifest form of the knowing subject.
The intermediate group consists of twelve tutis; the first group of
:130 TANTRASĀRA
six is nirvikalpa by nature, which veils the vikalpa form of knowl-
edge. Among these six tutis, one is innate nature in itself (svarūpa),
and the remaining five tutis are engaged in veiling determinacy
(vikalpa). The desire to open and the state of openness both consist
of two tutis because they are characterized by the well-manifested
form of activity. This is because an action or [subtle] vibration [of
an action] persists in the perceiver for more than one moment. The
state of openness and the state of being an agent with regard to
the objects of activity are thus established. Thus, because of the
fivefold nature of determinacy (vikalpa), which is to be concealed,
and because of nature in itself, the nirvikalpa state consists of six
moments: the state of nirvikalpa in the process of being dissolved,
the actual dissolution of vikalpa, the intention to open, the state
of openness consisting of two moments, and the state of open-
ness itself combined constitute the six tutis. Its own functioning
capacity is nothing but the form of being the nature of the knowing
subject; therefore, it is not counted separately. In the manner dis-
closed above, a person having proper discernment, following the
course of instruction by spiritual teacher, analytically discerns the
state of fifteen everywhere. 159

As the vikalpas become fewer, the number of tutis also
decreases, as in the experience of happiness which terminates inTANTRASĀRA 131
the state of nirvikalpa. 160 Even ordinary people, by means of rest-
ing (viśrānti) vikalpas in I-Consciousness, apprehend the nirvi-
kalpa state, the abode of reflective consciousness, which extends
up to the state of this-ness and is covered with an I-Consciousness
[that is] almost indistinct. This is like the state of unhappiness
resting in happiness, which begins to shine clearly only after grad-
ual reduction of vikalpas. This is known as close attentiveness161
regarding relation between the perceiver and perceived. This is the
view held by Abhinavagupta's teachers.
When the differentiation in the form of clear manifestation of
this-ness diminishes, and if it continues to diminish by twos, the
aspirant attains full penetration into Śiva (āveśa) for the duration
of two tutis. Of these two, the former is full in every respect while
the second, being practiced by absorbing it into omniscience and
omnipotence, rewards the aspirant with omniscience and omnipo-
tence. The same is not the case with first tuți, as stated by revered
Kallața: "tuțipāta, 162 and so on." In this context, the word "pata"
is understood to be the Devī, Śrīmatkālī, Mātrsadbhāva, Bhairava,
Pratibhā, etc. That is now enough of revealing what is an esoteric
secret. Thus, from the tuți belonging to mantramaheśvara onward,
the attainment in the respective spheres occurs by means of prac-
tice appropriate to a particular sphere. 163

Now, in the fifteenfold variations, waking and the other states
[of consciousness] are going to be examined. The knowable object
and the consciousness related to it, which causes diversity in con-
sciousness, being mutually dependent, are known as states [of
consciousness]. It neither belong to the object of knowledge alone,
nor to consciousness alone, nor are they separate from each other.
When any particular experience occurs, having externality as the
substrate, then this is the state of wakefulness which remains asso-
ciated with the knower, the knowledge, and the object of knowledge.
:TANTRASĀRA 133
When, on the other hand, any particular experience shines as
the substrate (adhisthāna)164 in the form of an instrument, which
appears as a desire, then this is the dreaming state. When knowl-
edge shines as the governing agent in the form of seed alone, then
this state is known as deep sleep. These three states, with refer-
ence to the object of knowledge, the instrument, and the subject of
right knowledge, are said to have a fourfold division each. When,
however, in place of the rest of the subjects, the emergence of light
occurs because of his inclination toward inwardly directed full-
ness and awareness unfolds, then that state is known as the 'fourth
state.' For example, the knowledge: "I see the form by means of the
instrumentality of knowledge" transcends the knower, known, and
knowledge. 165 The knowledge "I see" rests in the subjectivity of the
knower without any means and is in essence autonomy (svātantrya).
This fourth state is the giver of roles such as subjectivity, instru-
mentality, and objectivity, respectively, by means of proximity,
middle range, and distance. It is because autonomy is the giver of
the grace of these states that they are said to be threefold.
The yogins acknowledge these states by the names pindastha,
padastha, rūpastha, and rūpātīta, respectively. Those rich in
the subtlety of meditation call these states sarvatobhadra, vyāpti,
mahāvyāpti, and pracaya. The derivative meanings of these
names are given in the Tantrāloka, as well as the Ślokavartika
(Mālinīvijaya). That which permeates all the other states and is all-
inclusive and perfect is the state beyond the fourth (turyātīta). It
transcends all; therefore, it is denoted by the name mahāpracaya.
Moreover, that which is distinct, steady, and well-connected is
the waking state. That contrary to it is the dreaming state, which
is the state of experience of pralayākala souls. Deep sleep is non-
awareness of all the knowable objects, which is the state of expe-
rience of vijñānākala souls. The fourth state is the experience of
the process which makes the object nondifferent from the subject.
This is the state of experience of the mantra, mantreśvara, and
mantramaheśvara souls. The absence of difference from Śiva in134 TANTRASĀRA
any entities is the state beyond the fourth (turiyātīta). This is the
state that transcends all.
Now, how the fifteenfold variation occurs in the five states
with reference to different subjects is given below:
1. Jāgrat (waking state)-sakala in its innate nature
2. Svapna (dream)-Pralayākala
3. Suşupti (sleep)-Vijñānākala
4. The fourth-Mantra, Mantreśvara, Mantramaheśvara
5. Transcending the fourth-Śiva
In the thirteenfold variation following the order mentioned
earlier, in regard to the essential nature and pralayākala souls,
etc., five states also remain present there. Following the order of
the 'thing in itself' (svarūpa), the energy of vijñānākala and the
vijñānākala souls, the variation is elevenfold. In the ninefold vari-
ation, they are the 'thing in itself' (svarūpa), mantras, lords of the
mantra, the lords of these lords, śakti, and Śiva. In the sevenfold:
variation, they are the thing in itself, lords of the mantra, their
lords, śakti, and Śiva. In the fivefold variation, they are the thing
in itself, the energy of mantramaheśvara, śakti, and Śiva. In the
threefold variations they are the thing in itself, the icchā, jñāna,
and kriyāśaktis. In the principle called Śiva, though it is free from
distinction, yogins, rich in the perfection of enumeration, conceive
a fifteenfold division by means of the presence of the icchā, jñāna,
and kriyāśaktis.
The beautiful form devoid of rest in consciousness, seen
in the host of categories such as earth, etc., is not as
beautiful as that of the supreme subject, as his know-
able shines in multifarious ways. Take recourse to this
multitude of principles created in sequential order,
which are in essence indeterminate I-Consciousness
impregnated with autonomy and reflective awareness-
and attain your own Self.

Chapter Ten
[In the previous chapter], the path of principles (tattvas) has been
explained. Now the path called kalā, the subtle units of tattvas,
etc., will be described. It has already been stated that the specific
character which threads through all the worlds is called 'prin-
ciple' (tattva). In the same way, that which invariably abides in the
group of tattvas is named kalā. This is because kalā is capable of
fashioning or shaping (kalana) in a uniform way; for example, in
regard to the principle earth, it is nivrtti because a process of the
creation of the principles stops with it. 166
The kalā named pratisthā functions in the group of tattvas
beginning with water and ending with pradhāna because it is
instrumental in nourishing and replenishing. The kalā named
vidyā functions in the group of tattvas beginning with puruşa and
ending with māyā, because of which knowables begin to diminish
and the ascension of consciousness occurs. From pure vidyā to the
end of śaktitattva the śāntākalā operates. Due to its function, the
activity of veils (kañcukas) rest in tranquility. Therefore, there are
four spheres167 (andas): born of earth (pārthiva), born of prakrti
(prākṛta), born of māyā (mayīya), and born of śakti (śāktā). The
energies belonging to the earth and other tattvas have their abode
:136 TANTRASĀRA
-
in these spheres up to the end of the principle called śakti; there-
fore, in the principle śakti subtle tactile contact exists. 168 Tactile
contact possesses the nature of resistance, and therefore it is rea-
sonable to conclude that the spherical worlds exist up to the end
of the sakti principle. Furthermore, in the sivatattva, there is the
concived kalā called śāntātītā whose existence is created only
for the purposes of instruction, meditation, and worship. 169 The
supreme reality possesses absolute freedom; however, even there,
that which is beyond the scope of knowledge is also beyond kalā
(kalātīta). 170 Thus, the number of kalās is indeed five and the num-
ber of tattvas is thirty-six.

The knowable is twofold; following its division into
gross and subtle qualities, the total number of tattvas
becomes ten. Instrumentality is also twofold: first,
there is pure instrumentality, and second, instrumen-
tality is connected with agenthood. Thus, the number
of tattvas also becomes ten. Next to them are five tat-
tvas where instrumentality has become subordinate and
agenthood has become distinctly prominent. Next come
five tattvas that are the result of the purity of agent-
hood. The next five tattvas are those whose distinction
from one another dissolves with the intention toward
fullness. The thirty-sixth is the principle known as Śiva,
who is free from all limitations. When this is taught or
meditated upon, that in which the mind gets a solid base
is called the thirty-seventh principle. When this princi-
ple is also made an object of meditation, then the num-
ber of principles becomes thirty-eight; this does not
involve infinite regress, however, because when Śiva,
who is associated with unlimited freedom, is being
meditated upon, it terminates in the thirty-seventh tat-
tva. 171 However, the thirty-sixth principle has to be con-
ceived of as beyond all other principles. Here ends the
method of conceiving [grouping] all principles under
the scheme of five kalās.
When ātmākalā extends up to vijñānākalā, and vijñānākalā
extends up to Iśvara, and the remaining tattvas are pervaded by
Śiva, this is the method of conceiving all the tattvas under the138 TANTRASĀRA
threefold scheme. The same scheme should also be assumed in
regard to nine tattvas. 172
The threefold division of the sixfold path, in the form of the
worlds (bhuvanas), principles (tattvas), and kalās, which are of
the nature of gross, subtler, and subtlest, is on the side of objectiv-
ity. When, on the other hand, it takes its repose (viśrānti) in the
subject, the division is similarly threefold. 173 When it shines as the
instrument of knowledge in this subjective aspect, then it is called
the path of pada. But when the waves of agitation in the instru-
ment of knowledge are going to rest, then it is called the path of
mantra. When, on the other hand, the agitation is completely paci-
fied in the fullness of subjectivity, then the path is that of varņa.
When that very varņa takes rest in its fullness, it attains its own
nature. Therefore, it is proper to conclude that one path possesses
sixfold divisions.
The number of pada, mantra, and varņa is one, and
the number of the worlds is sixteen; thus, the princi-
ple earth is composed of the kalā called nivrtti. The
fire is number three and the eye is number two; there-
fore, the number of principles from water to prakrti is
twenty-three. The word rasa signifies number six and
śara number five; therefore, the number of the words is
fifty-six. This is pratiṣṭhākalā.
The number of syllables constituting the principles from
purușa to māyā are seven. The number of mantras and
padas is two, while the number of the worlds is twenty-
eight. This is vidyākalā. The number of principles are
three, that is, śuddhavidyā, īśvara, and sadāśiva. The
mantra here consists of three syllables, while the num-
ber of the worlds is eighteen. This is śāntākalā.
The number of pada, mantra, and principles (tattva) is
one, while the number of syllables is sixteen. This is
śantātītākalā. These three verses in āryā meter have been
composed by Abhinavagupta for the use of his students.TANTRASĀRA 139

Chapter Eleven
Whatever has been stated up to now174 can serve some as a direct
means for the attainment of liberation (apavargāptaye) using
the 'short-cut method' explained above. On the other hand, the
instruction given above can also lead others to initiation (dīkṣā),
performance of the rituals, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to give
an account of the nature of initiation (dīkṣā), rituals, and so on.
Here the question arises: Who is entitled to receive initia-
tion? In order to answer this question, the topic of the 'descent of
grace' (śaktipāta) is going to be discussed. Some are of the opin-
ion that worldly existence, which is rooted in ignorance, occurs
as a result of a lack of knowledge, but when ignorance is removed
upon the rise of knowledge, 175 the descent of grace takes place.
However, they should explain why and how this right knowledge
develops. If it is the outcome of deeds, then it would not be dif-
ferent from the results of actions; it would be a contingency of
being an object of enjoyment. If the person who is the enjoyer
(enjoying an object) is accepted as the recipient of grace, then
the 'fallacy of wideness' (atiprasanga) occurs. If the will of the
Lord is supposed to be the cause of śaktipāta, then the 'fallacy
of mutual dependence' (anyonyāśrayatā) occurs and, moreover,
it serves no purpose. This theory would also entail the question
of the Lord's partiality. Furthermore, it is not tenable to assume
that mutually opposed actions, having equal capacity to suppress
each other, could balance (past) actions in order that the descent
of grace might occur. 176 This view is not tenable because actions
are sequential and therefore are unable to oppose one another.
Even if it is accepted that they might oppose each other, the ques-
tion is raised as to how other actions, which are not opposing one
another, bestow their results. If actions that are not contradictory
to one another do not occur, then one would instantaneously drop
one's body. It is not correct to say that only the actions bestow-
ing the results of birth and life span are not suspended, and that
only those acts that grant experiences of happiness and suffer-TANTRASĀRA 141
ing remain suspended. This view is incorrect because it does not
answer the question of why, even if it is assumed that the descent
of grace occurs in the presence of such actions, grace is afraid of
the deeds that bestow the results of experience. Furthermore, if
the question of grace could be satisfactorily resolved by resorting
to the theory of the ripening of impurities, 177 then the question
of the nature of this theory needs to be answered, as well as the
question of its cause. By this question, all possible causes, such as
detachment, specific form of merit, service to righteous people,
association with saintly persons, and the worship of deities stand
refuted. Thus, arguments advanced by dualists are repudiated as
incoherent.
According to this nondual system of the autonomous Lord, we
maintain the position that the great Lord, by way of sportful play,
veils his innate nature and takes up the form of a bound being
(paśu); however, there is no contradiction regarding the distinc-
tion of space, time, and his innate nature. 178 Similarly, the Lord,
by removing (the freely chosen) limitations upon his innate nature,
reveals himself either instantaneously 179 or gradually 180 to that
recipient of grace called a limited knowing subject (anu). 181 The
great Lord is in essence autonomous, and it is He who causes śakti
to descend; therefore, the descent of grace, which is dependent
on nothing, becomes fruitful by the realization of one's innate
nature. However, for one desirous of enjoyment (bhogotsukasya),
the descent of grace depends on his deeds. Upon one desirous
of otherworldly enjoyments (lokottararūpabhogotsukasya), grace
descends through the agency of Rudra, Vişņu, and Brahmā, the
presiding authorities functioning in the sphere of māyā, [who are]
impelled only by the will of the supreme Lord. This kind of grace
yields results such as the attainment of the status of mantra know-
ing subject (mantrapramātā), etc., and (the capacity for) discrimi-
nation between [the principles of] māyā and purușa, purușa and
kalā, purușa and prakrti, and puruşa and buddhi, and thus bars
that kind of person from enjoying those fruits belonging to the
lower principles. For one desirous of enjoyment and liberation, the142 TANTRASĀRA
descent of grace has to depend on rituals when it comes to enjoy-
ments and is dependent on nothing when it comes to liberation;
therefore, the descent of grace is both dependent and non-depen-
dent. It is not proper to ask why the descent of grace occurs only
for that particular person. This is simply because the great Lord
shines in that particular way. This being the case, then to which
person might this kind of injunction related to (the enjoyment of)
some object be directed?182

The descent of grace is ninefold, with three variants: intense,
moderate, and slow, combined with a further threefold division:
supremely intense, moderately intense, and mildly intense. The
occurrence of supremely intense descent of grace results in the fall
of the body, whereupon the state of Parameśvara is attained. With
the descent of moderately intense grace, the recipient is himself
firmly convinced of the nature of reality and does not require any
aid either from the scriptures or from a teacher. In him, intuitive
knowledge opens automatically (prātibhajñānodayah), where-
upon, without undergoing external forms of purificatory rites, he
becomes the giver of enjoyment and liberation to others. This kind
of recipient of grace is called a teacher of pratibhā type. This
person is not required to observe any customary behavior as used144 TANTRASĀRA
in society. Even among the pratibhā type there may be the possi-
bility of comparative distinctions among recipients of grace. This
is because of the diverse nature of the will of the Lord. Though
being intuitive by nature, the person endowed with this type of
grace may rely on the scriptures; this he does only for the verifica-
tion of truth. Thus, some teachers belonging to the pratibhā type
may not be established in the śāstras, while others may be well
established in scriptural knowledge. Therefore, they are of vari-
ous types, but in all the cases the element of intuition (pratibhā)
reigns supreme. In the presence of the teachers of the pratibhā
type, other teachers have no authority. Just as in dualist systems
(Śaiva Siddhānta), sivas who have attained liberation are unable to
perform the functions of creation, destruction, etc., in the pres-
ence of the beginingless Śiva.
From the descent of mildly intense grace, a desire to approach
a right kind of teacher183 develops, while one's leanings in the
direction of incompetent: teachers disappear. It is only because
of grace that one goes toward the right kind of teacher from an
incompetent one. The true teacher is fully conversant with the
entire truth contained in śāstras. He is none other than the revered
Lord Bhairava. Even a yogin is the giver of release to others only
through the knowledge gained by practice. In this regard, his com-
petency as teacher comes from his identity with Śiva, while the
loveliness and charm that he might possess are not essential. The
incompetent teacher might possess all these other qualities except
union with Śiva.
Thus, the person who feels a desire to approach [such a] teacher
receives initiation, characterized by knowledge, through which he
immediately attains liberation while still living (jivanmukti). This
initiation takes place in different ways: by mere glance (avalo-
kana), through discourse, by enlightening the disciple regard-
ing śāstras, by means of viewing external rites, or by offering
semen and menstrual fluids. A person well practiced in meditation,
etc., receives initiation at that time which severs the bond of vital
energy (prāņa); however, this kind of initiation should be givenTANTRASARA 145
only at the time of death. This particular type of initiation will be
explained later. Thus, the intense type of descent of grace is of a
threefold nature.
One who receives initiation as a result of supremely moder-
ate grace does not feel a deep conviction regarding his identity
with Śiva. However, by gradual ripening of that realization, he
becomes Śiva after he drops his body. One upon whom grace
descends in a moderately moderate manner, although eager to
attain Śivahood, is overwhelmed by the desire for enjoyment. In
spite of this, this kind of person is a recipient of the pure knowl-
edge granted to him through initiation: He, in the present body,
experiences enjoyments obtained by the practice of yoga and
becomes Śiva at the time of dropping his body. From the mildly
moderate descent of grace one attains Śivahood only after experi-
encing enjoyments in another body after dropping the present one.
Thus, the moderate type of grace is also threefold.
When a person's eagerness for the enjoyment of pleasures dom-
inates, then the nature of grace is said to be slow. The recipient
of this grace becomes eager to attain identity with supreme Lord
through the means of yoga, such as repetition of mantra; because
mantras and the practice of yoga finally terminate in liberation,
they are decidedly of the nature of grace. Here also, as a result
of comparative distinction, the mild descent of grace is threefold.
These are the main principles of the descent of grace. Regard-
ing Vaisnavas and other systems, the descent of grace is like the
grace of the king and therefore does not culminate in liberation;
therefore, this type is not going to be discussed here. It has already
been stated that in every descent of grace, śakti abides as insepara-
ble from Śiva; however, this cannot be the 'supreme one' (jyeṣṭhā),
but either fearsome (ghorā) or dreadful (ghoratamā). 184 Although
already diverse, the descent of grace becomes further differenti-
ated by means of comparative gradation. A person belonging to
the Vaisnava and other orders, who follows the method prescribed
by the teacher but at the same time follows this śāstra of the five-
fold current, becomes in due order sufficiently mature and is able146 TANTRASĀRA
to gain the highest competency for receiving the Trika, the all-
transcending and supreme sāstra, which is revealed by the Lord.
Others attain (the highest competency for receiving the Trika) by
skipping some stages, thus creating indefinite divisions. Yet oth-
ers may attain (the same competency) instantaneously, i.e., with-
out any sequence (akrama). Thus, teachers belonging to the lower
orders are not entitled even to see the sacred diagram (mandala),
while the teacher belonging to the higher orders is instrumental
in enlivening the lower doctrines. He is able to do this because,
on account of his perfection, he is entitled to all the śāstras. This
kind of person is a teacher (daiśika), a guide (guruh), one who fol-
lows the rules and teaches others to follow them (ācārya), an ini-
tiator (dīkṣakah), or a voracious reader (cumbakah). Among them,
the best one is that one in whom the fullness of knowledge has
completely flourished, without which the fulfillment of initiation,
etc., would be impossible.
A yogin who is associated with a person desirous of attain-
ing results is capable of granting him immediate results by
instructing him to adopt a certain means (upāya) which will
lead him to his goal. If that person, through the means taught
to him, remains concentrated only on knowledge, then he may
also attain liberation. A person desirous of having perfect knowl-
edge should approach many teachers; he should remain close to
them, hoping to attain ever more superior knowledge of different
kinds. However, abandoning a teacher perfect in knowledge defi-
nitely requires a need for expiation (prāyaścitta). The question
might arise: What if the teacher does not give instruction, or he
gives erroneous instruction; shouldn't one abandon him? To that
we reply, "no," as that kind of teacher is free from attachment
because he has attained perfect knowledge and therefore has no
personal reasons for not revealing secrets. The teacher's silence
might be the result of lack of merit on the side of disciple or for
want of a surrendering spirit in the disciple. This disciple should
continue to make an effort to serve this kind of teacher and should
not abandon him. Thus, the descent of energy, having grace asTANTRASARA 147
its purpose, is indeed independent. If the descent of grace were
dependent on bad or good deeds, or restrictive causal laws (niyati),
then it would be nothing but the function of veiling belonging to
the Lord (tirobhāva).

'Veiling' or tirobhāva is indeed dependent on deeds, and it can
create such a situation as making one experience intense unhap-
piness and delusion. For instance, because of the free will of the
light (prakāśasvātantryād), a perfectly enlightened person can
behave like he is truly foolish and then blame that behavior on
being foolish at heart. Similarly, a foolish person can imitate the
behavior of an enlightened one, such as usage of the mantra in
worship, etc., and then blame it (on the behavior of an enlightened
one). However, compared to an enlightened one, the activities per-148 TANTRASĀRA
formed by a dullard, suited to an unenlightened one, although
performed, decline and finally end. The activity of an enlightened
one, being blamed as a forbidden behavior, makes the unenlight-
ened become doubtful of his potency, which is the functioning of
the 'power of veiling' (tirobhāvaśakti). This causes an enlightened
one to sink into the morass of delusion.
This veiling has no effect on a person upon whom grace has
fallen. In this instance, as in the previous example, it is not depen-
dent on deeds. In all of the following cases, because of the diver-
sity of the will of the Lord, tirobhāva persists: it results in suffer-
ing to be experienced only in this body; or in initiation followed
by practice according to convention, such as serving a teacher, a
deity, or sacrificial fire; or finding fault with them, like those
engaged in service or blame; or like those who were engaged in a
doctrinal order of Śiva, and who later abandon it. Even in these
examples of being influenced by tirobhāva, one may himself
receive the descent of grace as a result of the wonderful manifes-
tation of Lord's will, or one may receive grace even after death
through his teacher or relative. Thus, one is the sharer of the five
functions of the Lord coherently united in one's own self. There-
fore, he is none other but Parameśvara and should not think of
himself as being separate from him.
The Lord, who by nature is without any veil, covers his
nature of light by his freedom of will; in the same way
he unfolds it as well. In the domain of his non-enlight-
ened state, he behaves like an enlightened one and later
wakes up. The nature of the descent of grace is to be
independent.

It has been indicated earlier that initiation, rituals, and other
related matters should be discussed. Therefore, for the purpose of
determining the real character of initiation, the duties preliminary
to it will be presented.
Bathing (snāna) is said to be purity, and purity should
be understood as absorption into the pure essence of the great
Lord (Parameśvara). Removal of impurity is indeed purification.
Although identical with the innermost nature, impurity is errone-
ously regarded as being associated with characteristics extrane-
ous to it. For example, the conviction that the innermost nature,
although present in the Self as well as in the universe, which is
in essence perfectly free, blissful, and is consciousness alone, is
negated when it is associated with characteristics different from
consciousness. This erroneous notion is called impurity, which is
removed by means of absorption into the great Bhairava.
In some, this absorption occurs instantaneously, while oth-
ers require a means (upāya) for attaining it. This division of the
means in regard to different people may vary as one, two, three, or
they may be taken as a whole, or individually. This absorption can
happen to any individual, anywhere and at any time. In this way,
the division of the means becomes diversified based on the attain-
ment of the firm conviction (āśvasa) in the nature of reality on the
part of a practitioner.
Furthermore, this absorption is eightfold. By means of medita-
tion on the very nature of Parameśvara, and by the power of the
placement of the mantras (nyāsa) in the eightfold form of Śiva,
i.e., the earth, water, air, fire, ether, moon, sun, and the self
(ātmā), and in one's own body by gaining identity with it, one
becomes firmly absorbed in Parameśvara. In this way, a limited
soul, which functions differently as a body, etc., attains absorp-
tion in the Lord.
But to some (for those whose conviction is not as firm) bathing
and putting on fresh clothing cause satisfaction. Therefore, they
are regarded as the means for attaining Parameśvara. It is said in
the Śrīmadananda Tantra and similar texts that support, nour-TANTRASĀRA 151
ishment, invigoration, burning of impurities, pervasion, capac-
ity of creating, the capacity of maintenance, and nonduality are
the principal results. The mantra as a unifying element assumes
the form of this eightfold division mentioned before. However, in
regard to the viras, 185 they assume a specific nature; they are as
follows: the dust emerging out of the union (ranareņu), the water
of the vira, the great air, the ashes of the vira, the sky above the
funeral ground, the moon and the sun as connected with the previ-
ous two, and the self free from thought constructs.
This bathing, with variations of external and internal, is of
two types. 186 The external form is performed by attaining identity
with the mantra, and when this is attained, one is to be dissolved
into Śiva. 187 However, its particular form is carried out by means
of looking at the delightful substance (wine) in a vessel used by
vīras and having made it of the nature of Śiva, one should worship
the host of mantras in that very vessel. Then the 'wheel of deities'
who are abiding in both body and prāņa should be worshipped
by that very substance. This is known as the principal bath. The
inner bath is performed by means of concentration of the mind by
the respective forms of dhāraņā in the center of the earth, etc., in
order to become identical with that wheel of deities..
Immersion into the very nature of the Lord is called
bath. When this is correctly performed, only then does
an external bath becomes a ritual bath. The external
form of the bath is called a ritual bath only in the sec-
ondary sense.

Chapter Thirteen
After the ritual bath, one should proceed toward the place of wor-
ship in a delightful mood. 188 The place of worship is where heart
becomes filled with satisfaction and is well suited for the absorp-
tion into Parameśvara. 189 The place of worship does not have any
other characteristics. If any other characteristic is mentioned, it is
given only because it is instrumental in granting identification with
the object of meditation, which is attained because of mental tran-
quility. Therefore, there is no place similar to a place of worship.
The sacred spot (pitha), the mountaintop, etc., taught in the
śāstras as places of worship should be known as supporting this
description. The energies (saktis), possessing the state of absorp-
tion into Parameśvara and in accordance with his restrictive
energy (niyati), incarnate themselves at the various sacred places,
like the regions inhabited by the Aryans190 of good moral conduct,
and also the regions of barbarians prone to immorality. The moun-
taintops and other similar places are conducive to concentration
because of being isolated (solitary) and free from distraction.
Then, while standing outside, in front of the temple, the aspi-
rant should 'place syllables' (nyāsa) in a general way, first in the
fingers and then in the limbs of his body. This should be done with.TANTRASĀRA 153
two combinations of mantras: 'hrim,' 'nam,' 'pham,' 'hrim'; and
'hrim,' 'ā,' 'kșa,' 'hrīm' indicative of Śiva and Śakti, which are the
mantras of the mālinī and mātṛkā orders. If this 'placement of man-
tras' (nyāsa) is done with only one of these two, then it should first
be performed with malini, followed by matrkā. If nyāsa is done
for the purpose of attaining mokșa, then it should be done from the
feet all way to the top of the head. However, if enjoyment (bhoga) is
the objective, then it should be done in reverse. The goddess mālinī
is the principal form of sakti which, because of the close union
of vowels (bījas) and consonants (yonis), is capable of fulfilling
• all sorts of desires. Her name is aptly significant. She is adorned
with a garland of rudraśaktis blossoming in fruits, She is the hum-
ming bee of sound (nāda), capable of dissolving the ice of worldly
existence. She bears both spiritual perfection (siddhi) and libera-
tion (mokşa). She is associated with both the saktis of offering and
accepting, for the syllables "ya" and "ra" are identical, according
to Panini. Therefore, even the application of the mantra, which has
lost its traditional procedure, becomes perfect (comes to its fruition)
by the power of placement of mālinī. Impure Garuda and Vaişņava
mantras bestow liberation after becoming pure (by its efficacy).

After the placement of syllables (nyāsa) upon the body, the
placement is to be done on the sacrificial vessel (arghapātra) for
the ritual. In this system, the activities performed in the ritual form
of worship involving verbs and grammatical cases (kārakas)191 for
the purpose of steady realization of identification with the Lord
have been given as an example. 192 Here in the sacrificial vessel
(arghapatra)193 all the cases thus become one with the Lord.
By following the order of ritual activities in this way, all the
(grammatical) cases are transformed into the Lord. 194 When all
these activities are seen, with this insight, even without taking
recourse to the principal form of knowledge or yoga, one becomes
united with the Lord.
Thus, placing syllables (nyāsa) on the vessel for rituals and
worshipping with flowers, incense, etc., one should sprinkle the
flowers, the essence of the ritual, with small drops of water from
the vessel to consecrate them. Then in the orb of light, on the
ground, or in the void, one should worship the family of attend-
ing deities, uttering this mantra: "I pay obeisance to the external
deities of the main deity" (aum bāhyaparivārāya namaḥ). Then,
at the door [of the place of the sacrifice] one should worship with
mantra thus: "I pay my obeisance to the host of deities abiding at
the door" (aum dvāra devatācakrāya namah).
If the external place is not a sacred one, then entering at the
front diagram (mandala) and the altar, one should worship the
external deities of the family and the host of deities abiding at the
door, and should perform the placement of the above-mentioned
syllables, etc. This should be done inside the place of worship and
not outside. Then uttering the mantra 'phat' three times with a
flower in his hand, and energizing them with mantra 'phat,' he
should throw the flowers in the northeastern direction, and while
conceiving all the obstacles (as being) removed, should enter in
front of the mandala and should look on all the sides of the temple
kindled with rays of the light belonging to the Lord.

A person desiring liberation should sit facing north so that all
of his bonds may quickly be burnt by the flame of the fire emanat-
ing from the Lord Aghora. Regarding the notion of spatial direc-
tion (dik), it is stated that the Lord's freedom, by which the forms
(mūrtis) [of the spatial directions] are made manifest, is the very
principle of the spatial direction. The manifestation of conscious-
ness itself is the center (madhya), because all the different mani-
festations of directions make their appearance from that center.
The direction of 'above' is the region which is appropriated by the
light, but the direction which is not so (i.e., 'below') is the 'nether'
region. The 'east' is that which remains in front of that light. The
direction different from it is the 'west' because the 'east' receives
the light facing it. The 'south' is the direction towards which the
currents of light ascend. It is called 'south' (daksiņa) because of
its agreeableness. The direction facing it is the 'north' because it is
the region to be illuminated. This is the description of the fourfold
directions.
There in the center exists the Lord, his face called Iśānais in
the upper region, and below is his nether face. In the four quarters
beginning with east, etc., his faces, called Śrī Tatpuruşa, Aghora,TANTRASĀRA 157
Sadyojāta, and Vāmadeva, are located. In the middle of the above
four directions, there are located four other directions. Thus, it is
because of greatness of consciousness that the directions are mani-
fested, which are caused by the forms. 195 For this reason, direction
is not a separate principle (tattva); just as when one wants to cross
over one's own shadow, it (the shadow) always remains in front. In
this same way, the Lord always remains in the center. It has been
stated that superior to all is the state of being in the center. Thus,
as the Lord is the agent causing the division of directions, so also
is the sun. It has been stated in different texts that the sun indeed
• is the Lord's power of knowledge (jñānaśakti).
The east is that where the manifestation of light first occurs.
Where manifestation occurs, it (the east) is definitely there.
Although the directions, such as east, etc., are dependent on the
self, i.e., are subjective, the region that remains in the front of
a person is (always) east. Thus, the determination of direction
should be accomplished by bringing the self, the sun, and the Lord
into one single concept. This is the knowledge regarding direction
as thought by Abhinavagupta's teachers.
This being the case, one should sit facing north, and by aban-
doning a sense of egoism (ahambhāva), one should burn the
egoism of possessing a body in both the gross and subtle bodies.
Though the body still exists, it should be looked at as the bodies
of others, for the Self is without a body. Then one who is steadily
established in the tranquil and unchanging abode has a natural
inclination towards creativity. The first vibrative fractional unit
of it is indeed the arising of form (murti). Conceiving thus, one
should install on that form (murti) the host of divinities that are
worshipped, as it was prescribed before. Principally, the saktis
should be worshipped, for they are the seats of the nine-formed
energy belonging to the Lord. This is the view of our teachers.
There are five states beginning with waking, etc., but the sixth
is called anuttara, the 'innate state' (svabhāva daśā), which is to
be conceived as uniting all. Therefore, placement (nyāsa) should
be sixfold (upon the six cakras). In these different cakras, Brahmā,158 TANTRASĀRA
Vişņu, Rudra, Īśvara, Sadāśiva, and Śakti, the causal deities, are
abiding steadily in the host of thirty-six tattvas, separately in
each. By the application of nyāsa, one attains the fullness of Lord
Bhairava, who transcends the phenomenal principles. In this way,
the state of Bhairava becomes manifest. Therefore, in the case of
those who have attained the state of identity with Bhairava, the
performance of nyāsa, etc., is meaningless. For those who are
established in the tranquil state, what could be the utility of creat-
ing principles, nyāsa, etc.? In reply to this, we say that the tran-
quil state of the body of Bhairava is so vast that he is the final
terminating point in whose own nature the diversity of manifesta-
tions, dissolution, and creation remains manifest.
Thus, by means of the mutual union of the two, and by meditat-
ing on the vital air, body, intellect, etc., which have become trans-
formed into the Lord himself, one should worship both ("both"
refers to the union of the prāņa and Bhairava, the intellect and
Bhairava, the body and Bhairava) externally and internally with
flowers, incense, libations, etc., for as long as possible. Then in
the body, in the vital energy and in the intellect, one should install
the trident with the lotus accordingly.
This is as follows: 196 the root of the staff should reach the root
of the 'basic power' (ādhāraśakti). 197 The bulb is perfectly pure,
having solidity in the interior (with the capacity to hold all); the
staff goes up to the roof of the palate, where the opening exists. It
includes all the principles ending in kalā. It is named ananta. The
knot above it is characterized by māyā; the lotus of pure vidyā
is the quadrangular bedstead. It is there that the Lord Sadāśiva
abides. He himself is the great corpse (mahāpreta). He is called
mahāpreta because everything finds the excellence of rest there,
and because He is predominantly of the nature of consciousness,
due to the absence of a body in the form of knowable objects, and
because of being characterized by the cognition of nāda. Emerg-
ing from his navel and penetrating through the three openings of
his head are three prongs representing śakti, vyāpinī, and samanā,
above nādānta and at the end of twelve. Above them exist three
:TANTRASĀRA 159
lotuses with the nature of unmana. One should make this differ-
ence the seat of an all-pervasive superintending agent, so that it
may become one's basis. Then the desired deity should be con-
ceived as abiding there. The offering of the entire being to that,
which is the very essence of all entities, is called worship (pūjā).
That, which brings about absorption into it, is known as medita-
tion (dhyāna). The inner reflection of that, of nature existing in
the form of the primal sound (nāda), continuously oscillating, is
the repetition of mantra (japa). Following the order of cognition
of this very type, by whose force the great fire has been awakened,
and which has brought the entire universe to identity with one's.
own Self (viśvātmākaraṇam), is known as homa. After perform-
ing that, one should meditate on all the attending deities as arising
from the mass of fire as its ignited sparks, and one should worship
them in the above manner.
Meditating on the trident from the root extending up to
the end of twelve and resting at the top of the wheel of
the goddess (devicakra), one who becomes free from
sequence attains the state of wandering in the void of
consciousness.
From the base to the end of twelve, passing like a staff,
this consciousness wandering through the void is char-
acterized by its identification with the void beyond the
void. This is indeed void because of wandering through
the void, abiding in the void, and swallowing the nectar
of the void.

Thus, only by the inner form198 of oblation is the attainment of
the purpose really fulfilled, but in truth it is accomplished in one
in whom the state of absorption has occurred. Even then, external
rituals should be performed for the removal of limitations. For the
person who has not attained absorption of that nature, the exter-
nal form of ritual is the main form (of ritual practice). He attains
absorption by practicing it. However, even for him, the inner form
of ritual is essential for the removal of the state of the bonded
soul (paśu). When the external form of ritual is not firmly estab-
lished in his essence, then because of the strength of his desire it
becomes the giver of purity.
When a person is desirous of receiving initiation, for the pur-
pose of consecration one should select a spot of land, then worship
Ganesa and other Gods, worship the small jar and the big jar, wor-
ship the altar, and then perform oblation into the fire. Regarding
indispensable observances (nitya), occasional observances (naim-
ittika), the worship of the altar, and oblation into the fire should
be performed. Then, the ritual of the consecration of the disciple
4TANTRASĀRA 161
is performed for the purpose of producing in him the capacity to
receive the impression of purification. It is like making the teeth
sour, that is, to prepare him to become inclined to the duty toward
the Lord; and as regards the teacher, it is the acceptance of such
a disciple. As regards the materials existing in the place of ritual,
these should be conceived as worthy of becoming the right materi-
als for worship by energizing them with the nourishing energy of
the Lord, and then offering them.
Then, preparing this place of worship, abundant with all these
materials, the worshipper calls to mind the goddess mālinī or
mātṛkā, and while throwing a handful of flowers to the deity, he
should think of them as being filled with the light of rays of those
syllables. Then, energizing white mustard, paddy, washed rice,
fried rice, and so on with the mantra 'phat' and conceiving them
as flames of fire, one should throw them, beginning from the
northeast, in a given order. This is the procedure for the selection
of sacred spots.
:
Then, offering a seat ending in pure vidyā, one should perform
the worship of Ganesa. Next, he should worship the well-deco-
rated jar, filled with the substance of delight (wine). Then, placing
a betel nut (pūga) inside it, he should call to mind the root mantra
in the prescribed procedure as superintending over all, and then
he should make the jar charged with the mantra by repeating it
108 times. In the second jar, he should worship the mantra 'phat'
for the pacification of obstacles. After that, he should worship
the guardians of the quarters with their weapons in their respec-
tive quarters. Then, he should hand over the jar charged with the
mantra to a disciple who has been initiated previously, and the
teacher himself should take up the jar (kumbha). Then, following
the disciple, who goes on pouring water in an unbroken line (from
the left of the kalasa) in order to pacify obstacles up to the end of
the temple, the teacher recites the following mantra:
O Indra, in order to pacify obstacles in your direction,
you should remain alert by the order of Śiva to the end
of the ritual.162 TANTRASĀRA

With the name having three syllables, the word "hey you"
(bhoh) is to be uttered once. Thus, going round from the east he
should place the jar in the northeast corner, and the jar charged
with the mantra should be placed on the scatterings (of the offer-
ings) to the right of the kumbha. Then, worship of both jars should
be performed. After this, the worship of the Lord is performed at
the altar.
Then, conceiving the fire pit as the power of the Lord, and
:164 TANTRASĀRA
:
kindling a fire, unifying it with the fire of consciousness abiding
in the core of the heart, while cognizing the mantra along with it,
and conceiving the blazing fire as of the nature of Lord Śiva, then
placing mālinī and mātṛkā there, one should satisfy the mantra
with clarified butter and sesame seeds; sprinkling water from the
water jar consecrates the sesame seeds and the clarified butter,
and consecration of the large ladle and the short ladle is the glance
characterized by the nonduality of the Lord. Performing oblation
according to one's capacity, he should place both ladles one above
the other, mutually facing each other, representing Śiva above
and Śakti below. The worshipper should stand, placing the toes
of both his:feet parallel and straight. Then, he should conceive
that the full moon has arisen from the void, abiding in the end of
the twelve from which oozes out nectar, and that (this nectar) is
falling on the ladle. He should go on reciting the mantra, ending
with vaișad, and should remain standing until all the clarified but-
ter has been consumed. This final oblation satisfies all the host of
mantras.
Then, bringing caru (boiled rice to which clarified butter is
added while cooking) that has been purified by the sprinkling of
water and offering portions of it to the altar, the big jar, the small
jar, and into the fire, the teacher should keep one portion in order
to offer it to the disciple.
Next, the offering of the tooth-stick will be described. It should
be thrown by the disciple. If it falls to the southeast, south, and
southwest, or straight down, that is considered inauspicious. In
that case, oblation into the fire while uttering the mantra 'phat'
will remove the fault.
The teacher should then make the disciple stand before the
sacred diagram (mandala) blindfolded, without agitation, in order
for him to earn the right to have a glimpse of the mantra that he
will receive in the future. Then, he should sit on his knees and
throw a handful of flowers into the mandala. All at once, with the
blindfold over his eyes being removed, he sees the mantra directly
before him, because the means of knowledge, being graced byTANTRASĀRA 165
the descent of śakti, allows him to perceive the mantra near and
directly, and he becomes identical with it. The nearness of the
mantra is directly perceived by those whose sense organs have
been favored by the grace of sakti, but those possessed by demons
see it with dread.
Then the teacher, worshipping on the right palm of his hand the
host of brilliantly blazing deities with his left hand, should place it
on the top of the head, heart, and navel of the disciple, burning all
the bonds of impurities. Then to the left of the disciple, worship-
ping the rejuvenating deity having a mild nature, he should pay
obeisance to him; then, outside of the place of worship, he should
present the offering of wine, meat, and water to the ghosts (bhūta)
and the deities governing all the directions. Then he should purify
himself by sipping water. Then, eating the boiled rice (caru) along
with the disciple, the teacher should remain awake in the enlight-
ened state while maintaining the unity of his own self with the
self of the disciple. In the morning, if the disciple tells him about
dreams that he had during his sleep at night, the teacher should
not give him an interpretation of these dreams at that time, as he
could become doubtful and afraid of them. In order to relieve
the disciple, the teacher should worship the deity with the man-
tra 'phat.' Then, worshipping the Lord in the former manner and
placing the disciple before the Lord, the teacher enters the body
of the disciple through the channel of the vital energy, and should
touch the disciple's six cardinal spots, i.e., the heart, the throat,
the palate, the forehead, the aperture above the head, and the 'end
of twelve' (dvādaśānta). Thus touching the six causal deities, he
should conceive eight purificatory rites in each of the superintend-
ing deities, and making the vital energy of the disciple rest for the
moment in each spot, he should repeat this procedure. In this way,
when forty-eight purificatory rites199 are performed on a person,
attainment of a portion of Rudra occurs in him, with the result
that he becomes samayin. Then he should worship the mantra with
flowers, etc.
Then, the teacher should narrate the conventional rules for him
:166 TANTRASĀRA
to follow.200 One should show devotion to the spiritual guide in
every way. The same devotion should be shown to the holy texts
and to the deity. One should be disinclined to contrary schools
of thought. One should see the son of the spiritual guide as one's
own. The person who is related to him in connection with study of
the text and the person who has been previously initiated should
be looked upon with regard. For the purpose of paying regards,
one should not think of them as having been born of sexual union.
It should be kept in mind that this does not come automatically.
Barren women should not be looked down upon as the cause of
hatred. The name of the deity, the name of the teacher, and the
mantra should not be uttered except during performance of the
rituals. One should not make use of the bed, etc. which has been
used by the teacher. Wordly sports, whatever they may be, should
not be done before the teacher. One should not regard others as
superior to one's own teacher. On occasions such as ceremonial
rites observed for a deceased person, only the spiritual guide is
to be worshipped. During occasional rites, one should not utter
the word śākinī, etc. One should perform worship on the days
of festivals. One should not associate closely with Vaisnavas and
others who hold a lower view of the truth. One should not look at
those belonging to this doctrine as being members of their former
castes, but as being identical to Śiva. 201 When the members of the
teacher's family come to the house, one should perform sacrifices
according to one's ability. A person belonging to a lower order
of Vaisnava, etc., should be avoided, even though he has been
made a teacher, owning to the desire of knowing their doctrines.
Even so, he should not be looked upon as being superior to one's
own teacher. One should not associate with Kāpālikas, etc., and
compare one's doctrines with theirs. One should worship in accor-
dance with one's own capacity. One should abandon all doubts.
While sitting in the cakra, the divisions of younger and older,
which occurred due to birth, should not be brought to mind. One
should not regard temples and sacred places with greater esteem
than the body. One should keep the ultimate truth of the mantra inTANTRASĀRA 167
mind continuously.
Thus, listening to these conventional rules, and approaching
the teacher, prostrating before him, propitiating him with money,
one's wife, and even by one's person as his fee, one should then
satisfy those who have previously been initiated, as well as those
who are poor and helpless. Then, one should worship the mūrti-
cakra in the foregoing manner. In this way, the disciple becomes
the follower of conventional rules which lead him to the ultimate.
One earns competency in the practice of mantra, daily rituals, in
listening to a holy text, and in its study. In regard to occasional
worship, only the teacher is to be prayed to. This concludes the
instruction on the subject of conventional rules.
After meditating on all the paths abiding in one's
own Self, one should conceive one's self as being full.
Therefore, with a look of grace, one should see the dis-
ciple's self pervaded up to the end of the twelve. In this
way he becomes transformed into samayin.

Chapter Fourteen
Now, the procedure of putraka 202 and other types of initiations
will be elaborated. This is an elaborate procedure, and it should be
properly understood by studying the Tantrāloka; however, it will
also be explained here.
After completion of the procedure for attaining the status of:
samayin, one should perform rituals on the third day for all the
deities in the sacred diagram (mandala), consisting of the tri-
dent and the lotus. There, the external family (parivāra)203 of
the deities and the group of deities of the doors204 should be wor-
shipped outside. Then, to the east of the sacred diagram, begin-
ning from the northeast to the southeastern part of the mandala,
one should worship Gaņeśa, the teacher, the teacher's teacher, the
great-grand-teacher, the perfected teachers of the past, the host of
yoginis, the Goddess of Speech (Vāgīśvarī), and the guardian of
the field, in linear order. 205 After receiving the proper permission
from them, he should place the entire sixfold path there, beginning
from the root of the trident to the end of white lotus, and should
then worship them.
After this, in the middle trident, on the middle prong, he
should worship the venerable goddess Śrīparābhattārikā together
with Lord Bhairava. On the left prong venerable Śrīmadāparā,
and on the right prong venerable Śrīparāparā, together with Bhai-
rava, should be worshipped. On the right trident, occupying the
middle prong is goddess Śrīparāparā, and on the left trident the
goddess Śrīmadāparā occupies the middle prong, and the other
deities are to be placed accordingly. Thus, as the supreme God-
dess is predominant over all, everything attains fullness because
of that superiority. Then, in the middle prong of the middle tri-TANTRASĀRA 169
dent, the entire group of deities, ending with their weapons (astra),
the guardians of the quarters, should be worshipped, conceiving
them as being identical with the supreme Goddess. It is because
of her superiority over all that it is conceived that everything has
been worshipped. After this, in the small jar, in the big jar, in
the sacred diagram, in the fire, and in one's own self, these five
substratums are to be unified with nonduality. Then he should
perform the specific worship with flowers, etc., which were nour-
ished by the nectarine fluid of the supreme Lord's essence of non-
duality. Furthermore, one should fill the ritual ground with liba-
tions of water and materials for offering, free from any deceit
regarding the spending of money. If the person lacks money, then
the ritual called mahāmandalayāga should not be performed. He
should offer living animals. In this way, the animals also become
recipients of grace. By doing this, one is showing compassion to
the animal and should not have any doubt regarding the efficiency
of animal sacrifices.

Then, propitiating Parameśvara with offering of sesame seeds
mixed with clarified butter, he should place the animal before
the fire for the offering of marrow into it. 206 After this, he should
propitiate the host of deities with that marrow. Then, addressing
the Lord and conceiving one's own Self as not different from all,
and being perfectly full of the six paths, the teacher should bring
the disciple in front of him. But in this initiation, which is per-
formed indirectly in the absence of a disciple who is going to die,
the teacher should conceive the disciple as being present in front
:TANTRASARA 171
of him, or place a substitute made of kuśa grass or cow dung. The
teacher, after sprinkling him with drops of water from the ves-
sel and worshipping him with flowers, etc., should place all six
paths into his body. The teacher should contemplate in this way:
The merit of one desirous of enjoyment should not be purified;
however, for one desirous of liberation, both merit and demerit
should be purified. For one who is to receive the nirbija form of
initiation, 207 the bonds of conventional duties should also be puri-
fied. This form of initiation is given to one who is about to die,
or who is extremely dull. This is the command of the great Lord
Parameśvara. Such a person also attains perfection by his devotion
to the teacher, god, or fire...
Here the distinction in attainment lies in the nature of one's
latent impressions (vāsanā), for mantras grant different results
according to one's latent desires. Therefore, ascertaining the
nature of the latent desires of the disciple, the teacher cognizes
the principal mantra internally and meditates on his identity with
nondual Śiva, and by doing so he purifies all the paths abiding in
the disciple's body. In this way, his body, from the small toe to
the 'end of twelve' (dvādaśānta), and his consciousness should
be made one with the body and the consciousness of the disciple.
Having accomplished this, he should rest in the immense lake of
bliss, the essence of which is autonomy and Lordship, perfectly
full, with the will, knowledge, and activity of the Lord of the host
of deities, full of all paths, the entirety of the sphere of entities
terminating in consciousness. By means of this kind of initiation
with the self of the disciple, the disciple becomes identical with
the supreme Lord.
Then if the disciple is desirous of enjoyment, he should be
united with the desired principle, either collectively or individu-
ally. After this, the teacher should conceive that the disciple has
offered his body, composed of the pure principle, and that he has
emerged immediately from the nature of the Lord for the purpose
of an experience of the result still remaining to be enjoyed. The
nature of this initiation is such as to disentangle all sorts of bonds.
:172 TANTRASĀRA
Then, the student should worship the teacher by offering payment,
etc. to him.
After this, rituals in the sacred fire with reference to the disci-
ple should be performed. Uttering the śrīparāmantra, the teacher
should say: "I am purifying this or that principle related to that
particular person." This utterance ends with 'svāhā.' Thus, three
oblations are to be performed. These oblations, as well as the final
one, are to be done with the mantravaușat at the end. In this way,
all the principles ending with Śiva are purified. Then, following
the procedure of unification, the final oblation should be offered.
After this, in regard to a person desirous of enjoyment, one obla-
tion for establishing the disciple in the place of enjoyment, and the
other for creating the pure principle should be offered. After com-
pletion of this, the teacher should be worshipped by the disciple,
and by the offering of payment, etc., to him. This is the nature of
the putraka form of initiation, by means of which all the past and
the future deeds barring the present one, are purified.
The well-enlightened teacher, after conceiving his own
existence composed of all the paths and combining it
with the interior and exterior, without any distinctions,
should make the intellect, the vital energy, and the body
of the disciple one with him.
When the disciple, after attaining all at once the state of
great bliss and consciousness, gets his rest there, then
the pasu attains the nature of Śiva.

Chapter Fifteen
When a teacher learns by himself, or through relatives, of a
descent of grace on a person who is about to die, 208 he should give
him the immediate ascension type of initiation (samutkramaņa
dīkṣā). Then the teacher, having placed all six paths in the dis-
ciple and purifying each of the six, one by one, should place the
goddess Kālārātrī in the center of the delicate joints of the body
(marma). 209 Then he should gradually pierce the bonds of the deli-
cate points by her, 210 and should then lead the consciousness of
the disciple and place it into the brahmarandra. Then, following
the aforesaid method, he should offer the final oblation for the
purpose of unification so that, after it is offered, and after the
individual self exits the body, he may become identical with Lord
:174 TANTRASĀRA
Śiva. However, for the one who is desirous of enjoyment, the sec-
ond final oblation is offered for the purpose of associating him
with the place of enjoyment. At that moment211 his individual self
remains dissolved there, and for him nothing remains to be done
in this world.
In addition to this, a teacher may recite the brahmavidyā 212
into the ear of the disciple. Brahmavidyā, being of the nature of
the reflective consciousness, causes an immediate self-reflection
of enlightenment in the limited consciousness of the awakened,
bound soul. The samayins and others are also entitled to recite
it. 213 If the nirbīja type of initiation with conviction (sapratyaya) 214
is given to a dullard on whom the descent of grace has occurred,
then the 'hand of Śiva' (Śivahasta) type of procedure should also
be disclosed to him. This procedure is followed during offering of
the hand of Śiva (Śivahastadāna) to him.
There is a fiery triangle, dreadful with flames, from which
sparks of fire with the syllabic form of "ra" are emerging. It is
being blown from outside by waves of wind. This diagram should
be meditated upon using the palm of the teacher's right hand.
Throwing a seed there, one should conceive that it has the syl-
lable "ra" above and below, by which a series of 'phat' mantras
are awakened, which burn its capacity of creativity. 215 Thus, the
seed of both become seedless by this type of initiation. It becomes
capable of destroying its latent seed power, as has been stated,
and even immovable objects are capable of receiving an initiation.
The disciple should be conceived as being steadily established in
the world of air and carried by it, and should also be conceived as
being light in weight. Then, he is seen as being lighter when mea-
sured on the scale. 216
If mantra cuts the delicate joints of the body, and if
lightness appears and the power of germination of
the seed disappears, the great Lord leads one who is
engaged in the right path to attain the desired ends
immediately.अथ षोडशमाहिकम् ।

Chapter Sixteen
In this chapter the initiation of one who is not present will be
described. This type of initiation is twofold, i.e., for the person
who is dead, and for one who is still alive (but not present). If a
person who offered service to the teacher but died before initia-
tion, or was sent into exile, or was killed by black magic (incan-
tation), etc., or by accident, he should be given initiation if he
becomes intent on receiving it at the time of death, or if a teacher
finds out from others that the descent of grace has occurred in
him. 217 This is the command of the Lord.176 TANTRASĀRA
During the performance of initiation for one who is dead, there
is no need for consecration, etc. In the sacred diagram for the
proximity of a particular mantra, detailed ritualistic activities
are needed: exquisite materials, like flowers, and so on; a place
as the sacred seat, and so on; the mandala, the sacred diagram,
like a trident with a lotus, and so on; a figure (akrti) as the spe-
cific form to be meditated upon; the mantra itself as self-effulgent.
These [ritualistic activities and materials] are for the meditative
yogins and jñānis who are immersed in meditation, who possess
right knowledge, and who are devoted to the Divine. They are the
causes for the proximity of the mantra according to their order of.
priority and posteriority. What more can we say about those who
have attained the perfect nature of the Lord?
After worshipping the Lord, the teacher places a figure made
of kuśa grass, etc., and should look at it following the method
received from his teacher. That is:
:
When the energy has risen from the mūlādhāra cakra
upward, a shaft (danda) from which innumerable sys-
tem of channels (nādis) come and spread out, the yogin,
by his power, should bring the shaft under control,
which should be thought to have gone to the void of the
nose, and then thrown outside in order to cause it to
pervade the entire world. Then, it should be thrown to
the extent that, from the abode of fire, plenty of smoky
flames may emerge and cover the entire path with its
net. This is the application of the great net218 to drag the
desired soul near.
By the application of this great net, the host of paths
which are to be covered come under control and are
placed before first and then are brought near later. If all
are brought before, even then only the intended one is
rescued or drawn before. This application, named net
for rescuing and drawing of dead souls, I learned from
Śrī Śambhunātha.TANTRASĀRA 177

If this is so, why does it not happen so externally? Is the
answer then that without proper practice in dragging it cannot be
fruitful? No; when one becomes engaged in such activity, if the
teacher is possessed by love and hatred, he could lose his absorp-
tion of lordship internally. Therefore, in that case, the teacher
remains conditioned by the restrictive power of niyati, so practice
is unavoidable. But here, in the teacher, on account of the presence
of the absorption of [in] the Lord, which is the characteristic of
grace, he becomes free. The Lord himself, by taking recourse to178 TANTRASĀRA
:
the body of the teacher as his substratum, bestows grace on those
who are to be blessed with grace. It is true to say that grace has
unthinkably glorious capacity.
Thus the soul, which is drawn by the application of the net,
enters the figure made of kuśa grass or the fruit of a jāti (Jas-
minum grandiflorum). However, it does not move because of the
absence of the mind and the vital energy, or the totality of causes,
but by the force of deep contemplation-it does indeed move.
Though it is of such a nature, the purificatory rite of consecration,
and so on, is to be performed, which terminates in the final obla-
tion and unification with the desired end. Then, by means of the
final oblation, the figure made of kuśa grass and other materials
should be dissolved in the highest light of the Lord. Thus rescued,
the soul, by the final oblation, attains liberation, whether it was
in hell, the world of the spirit, or in the world of lower animals.
But if the soul is living as a man, then he obtains at that moment
knowledge, yoga, initiation, or discernment, because the body of
the teacher is a competent authority regarding this. This is the
procedure for rescuing the dead.
This is the method for a person who is alive but absent when
the descent of grace occurs. Only the figure made of kuśa grass
and attraction are excluded. In this regard, the appearance of his
thorough contemplation is sufficient for his purification.
Initiation, again, is the bestower of both enjoyment and lib-
eration, because latent traces of the impression of past deeds are
strong and because it is impossible to root out all these desires. In
initiation, the consecration performed according to the procedure
of the higher doctrine is stronger, but that of the other inferior
doctrines requires further consecration for the purpose of puri-
fication. Even the person who is initiated in absentia experiences
manifestation of knowledge, and so on.
What a wonder that the teacher, by his steady absorp-
tion in the Great Lord, becomes the sharer of the free-
dom of will. Even viewing the person, though absent,
he becomes the initiator.TANTRASARA 179

Chapter Seventeen
Reclamation of the linga 219
The following is the procedure of initiation for those who
belong to orders beginning with Vaisnava, etc., and ending with
southern doctrines, or those who have followed religious codes of
conduct conforming to other orders, and also those who, although
being established in the highest doctrine, are engaged in attending a
teacher who belongs to a lower order, when they are made inclined
[to receive initiation] by the descent of the grace of the Lord.
Such a person should fast the day before initiation, and then
the following day, after worshipping the Lord in a general way, he180 TANTRASĀRA
should be brought into the presence of the Lord, and his all past
deeds should be recounted before him. Then, on receiving his
mantra from a teacher, the mantra he received from other teachers
should be thrown into the water. Next, he should be bathed, then
sprinkled with water from a vessel, purified with food cooked in
a sacred fire (caru), and [his mouth cleaned with a] tooth stick,
and should enter the place of the ritual blindfolded. He should
worship the great Lord with the general mantras. 220 After this,
one should purify his vrata/mantra in the fire transformed into
Śiva using the general mantras. Then, placing his name between
the mantra (as prefix and suffix) saying, "I purify his expiation,"
and ending with 'svāhā,” he should offer oblation one hundred
times. Next with 'vaușat,' he should offer the final oblation. After
this, he should evoke the lord of vrata (Vrateśvara) and offer puri-
fied butter into the fire. Then, by the order of Śiva in regard to
the disciple: "You, Vrateśvara, be impartial to him, and do not
cause obstacles for him," should make the deity aware of it. Hav-
ing prayed in this way, he should propitiate Vrateśvara and then
take leave of the fire. This is the method for the reclamation of the
linga. Then other purificatory rites should be performed as before.
Now the disciple is ready to give dīkṣā according to his will.
When a person remaining in the lower order, being
keenly touched by the power of the Lord, becomes
inclined to approach the true teacher, he should, after
purification, be given initiation even though he was for-
merly engaged with a false teacher.

Chapter Eighteen
The anointment (abhişeka)
:
The person in whom maturity of knowledge has developed
should be given anointment in order to follow the course of a
sādhaka, or to become a spiritual guide (guru) to others. This is
because only the person who possesses knowledge, even though
devoid of all the other characteristic qualities, has earned the
authority to follow the course of a sādhaka, or to bestow grace on
others, even though he might have received anointment. 221 If the
teacher not perfect in knowledge abstains from giving initiation,
he does not incur sin. However, the former one, who possesses
knowledge, incurs sin because he is duty-bound, for he is consid-
ered to be the bestower of the status of the lord of vidyā. Therefore,
being of such nature, if he abstains from giving initiation, this is
his sin.
After anointment for the purpose of fulfillment of identity
between the mantra and the deity, the new teacher should observe
the regular rituals of mantra every day for a period of six months
through the repetition of mantra, oblation into the fire, and per-
:182 TANTRASĀRA
formance of specific worship. 222 From then on, being one with the
desired deity, he earns the right and authority of giving initiation,
etc., to others. However, he should not initiate an unworthy one,
nor should he avoid one who is worthy. 223 Even the initiated one
should be tested by a teacher while bestowing knowledge. The
person who receives knowledge deceitfully should be looked at
with indifference after this is known to be so. In this anointment,
worship of the deities should be performed in accordance with the
financial capacity of the person concerned.
The person who himself is well practiced in knowledge
and bears the authority in himself, and is able to trans-
mit that knowledge to others, possesses the nature of a
sādhaka on the way to becoming a spiritual guide. Such
a person should be given anointment.

Chapter Nineteen
People, and even teachers, who followed lower doctrines should be
given an initiation called the 'final purificatory rite' or 'last sacra-
ment' (antyasamskāra dīkṣā), 224 which should be performed fol-
lowing the procedure of reclaiming the dead, provided the descent
of grace has touched them. The same applies to those who had fol-
lowed the order of the higher doctrines, but who have fallen from
the right path and have not performed any rites of atonement. This
is the command of the great Lord.
All that was described as the procedure for the reclaiming of
the dead should be performed on the corpse. The burning of the
body is done as the final oblation. The teacher should perform
the final rite for the dead person, for the confirmation of the faith
(pratyaya) of the ignorant, 225 according to his power of activ-
ity, knowledge, and yoga. Then, in the body of the deceased, the
teacher should place the mantras (nyāsa) from the feet to the head,
and, drawing the departed soul near by the application of the net,
he should arrest it, penetrate it, stir it, and enliven it with the
transmission of the vital energy to the heart, the throat, and on the
forehead. In this way, the corpse begins to shake. Then, the rite
:184 TANTRASĀRA
of the unification with the great Lord being performed, the body
should be burnt as the final oblation.
After this, the initiation called śrāddhadīksā 226 should be per-
formed even for those who have been purified by means of the
final rites of the dead, and also for those who have not been puri-
fied in this manner. For them, this final rite should be performed
on the third or fourth day, every month, or every year.
Then, completing the rite ending with oblation into the fire,
one should take up a food offering in one of his hands and, con-
ceiving his power as the virile energy of the Lord representing
the enjoyable object, which has assumed the power abiding in the
limited self and has made her-identity with it, contemplating thus,
the performer should offer it to the great Lord, the supreme agent
of the enjoyable object. 227
In this manner, when enjoyment ceases, one becomes indeed
the master. Although by means of initiations, such as the rite for
the dead, the reclamation of the body, and initiation during the
śrāddha ceremony, one attains the fulfillment of one's aim in
regard to those who are desirous of enjoyment, an abundance of
ritualistic activities are performed for the attainment of a pleni-
tude of fruits. Therefore, all should be performed in regard to a
person desirous of liberation for the attainment of oneness with the
deity; this is performed daily throughout one's life, like other daily
practices. But the knower of reality needs no procedure beginning
with the final ritual for the dead (offering into the flame) and end-
ing with śrāddha, etc. The death of such a person is a 'day of festi-
val' (parvadinam) for the disciples, for it fulfills the shortcomings
of consciousness of those who follow the lineage. The descendent
of the teacher has a single end which, in essence, is nothing but the
supreme reality. This day of ceremony is like the day of receiving
the seed of the lineage from the teacher while he was alive.
Everywhere in the ritualistic procedure of śrāddha, etc., the
mūrtiyāga is the most important one. This is supported by the doc-
trine called Śri Siddhāmata. The procedure of it will be described
in the naimittika section.TANTRASĀRA 185
Śiva is by nature inclined to show grace. Being so
inclined, the person on whom He shows grace unavoid-
ably becomes identical with the Lord. It is merely his
will by which the means (upāya) are imagined to be so.
Though knowing this, the wise person takes recourse
to means having limitations, and then he remains free
from doubts.

Chapter Twenty
Here, another chapter is introduced with the purpose of showing
the lifelong course to be followed after initiation (śeṣavartana).
That initiation, which is given to those worthy of knowledge
for the purpose of steady attainment of purification, is also given
to those unworthy of knowledge, but to them it is given for the
purpose of attainment of liberation. This type of initiation is the
sabīja type. 228 Thus, having given initiation, the teacher should
instruct the disciple about the duty to be performed during the
remaining period of his life.
The duty for the rest of [the initiate's] life is threefold: indis-
pensable observances (nitya), occasional observances (naimittika),
and those performed with a particular desire (kāmya). The last
one is only observed by those desiring enjoyments (sādhaka) and
therefore will not be described here. The nitya is the one which
occurs regularly; the naimittika is the one by which one is able to
attain oneness with the Lord. The auxiliaries to it are the prayers
during the junctures (sandhyā) of the day, which are to be per-
formed on a daily basis, on the day of the festivals (parvadinam),
and on the day of the offering of kuśa grass (pavitrakam), etc.:
TANTRASARA 187
They should also be considered daily observances, for they are reg-
ulated by the time of their occurrences. This is the view of some.
However, there are occasional (naimittika) observances that
are not regular in regard to the followers of the lineage of the
teacher, as, for example, the time of the arrival of the spiritual
teacher and his relatives, the day of a festival related to him
(tatparvadinam), the day on which he received knowledge, etc.
This is also the view of some. In these instances regular worship,
the prayers at the junctures of the day, worship of the spiritual
teacher, worship during the day of a festival, and worship of the
pavitrakam also need to be performed without fail,
The occasional observances (naimittikas) are the days on which
the disciple obtained knowledge, the day when he received the
holy text (śāstra), the arrival of the teacher and his relatives in
his house, his birthday, the day of his initiation and the day of his
departure from this world, secular festivals, the exposition of the
scripture (i.e., the commencement of it, the intermediate [phase],
and the completion of it), the day on which he perceived the
desired deity, the day of union with the spiritual partner (melaka),
a command received in a dream, and release from the observance
of convention (samaya). All these are the conditions for perform-
ing special kinds of worship as occasional rites.
Then the disciple who has been initiated previously should be
given the principal mantra, which possesses a potency of its own,
which is in essence the pulsating consciousness of the mouth but
without being written down. 229 Then the said disciple, for the pur-
pose of being identified with God, should practice to attain one-
ness with God during the junctures of the day. Then, by means of
that, for the attainment of such a sort of impression, one should
worship the great Lord every day on the altar or in the linga.
Regarding it, in a beautiful altar, one should contemplate one's
own form as reflected in a mirror and it should be considered that
one's own Self has become identical with the host of deities to be
worshipped there. He should perceive it to be the reflected image188 TANTRASĀRA
of the deity himself. Realizing thus, he should worship it with
an offering of beautiful flowers, sandal paste, wine, propitiatory
offerings of water, burning incense, lighting a lamp, presenting
various materials, praising with songs, a recital of musical instru-
ments, and then should recite hymns in order to obtain undeviat-
ing identity with the desired deity. Just as [when one is] looking
continuously at one's own face in the mirror, determination of its
real nature occurs without any delay. Regarding this, no particular
order is needed except attainment of one's identity with the man-
tra. The one who has attained absorption into the highest mantra
and from whose nature the taints of the impressions of bonded
beings have ceased as the result of the penetration of the flow of
devotion, for him the net of all the bonds has dissolved and what-
ever remains in the heart is the highest, agreeable to all. This is
the view of our teachers.
The power of sight, composed of the highest nectar arising
sportingly, basing itself on the light, extending as the supreme
truth of entities, the knowers of the secret worship you with it.
Making the earth as the base of all, and sprinkling it
with the fluid of delight, and collecting flowers made
of one's own mood emerged from the mind, having
defused perfume, and placing it on the vessel of the
priceless heart of my own-full to the brim with the
nectar of bliss-I worship You, along with the divine
Goddess, day and night in the divine temple of my body.

Thus contemplating the import of the two verses above in the
core of one's heart, one should meditate on the host of deities.
Then, showing mudras, repeating the mantra, and lastly, offer-
ing it, follows one after the other. The withdrawal (visarjanam) is
its identity with consciousness. The main food offering should be
eaten by oneself or should be thrown into the water. The creatures
born in water had formerly been given initiation by means of eat-
ing caru (sacred boiled rice). If the caru is eaten by a cat, a mouse,
or a dog, then, doubt having arisen, it becomes the cause of hell.
: The knower of the truth, with a desire of showing grace to the
world, should not behave contrary to the social order or remain
secluded from it. Thus, here ends the worship of the altar.
Next is the instruction regarding the linga. 230 The linga should
not be installed with the application of sacred mantras. This is
particularly true for the vyakta form of linga. One should wor-
ship lingas [that are] firmly established, following the order of
invocation and withdrawal, because this is the basis of all worship.
In this regard, one should worship the body of the teacher, one's
own body, the body of the sakti, the text in which sacred mantras
exist, the vessel used by the heroes (vīrapātra), a rosary, a weapon
(prāharaņa), a linga collected from Narmadā river (bāņalinga),
a linga made of pearl, made of gold, made of flowers, made of
charming materials like sandal paste, etc., or a mirror as the linga.
It is by the force of the substratum (mūlādhāra) that the excel-
lence of the attainment of perfection in mantras occurs. Hence,
prior and posterior to it is the main, as the mantras act in concert
with the quality of the substratum. Therefore, in accordance with
the difference of aim to be attained, that very end is considered190 TANTRASĀRA
to be the main. This is the view of our teachers. The best of last-
ing impressions is the conception of one's own identity with the
supreme Lord.

:
The Procedure for (the Celebration of) Festival Days (Parvadinam)231
(Those days marked as a) festival day can be divided into general,
general-general, general-special, special-general, special, and
special-special; this is its sixfold division. This occasion is called
a day of festivities (parva) because on that day the completion of
a procedure (vidhi) is celebrated. The first and fifth days of every
month are general occasions for festivities. The fourth, eighth,
ninth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of both halves of the fortnight are
general-general. Both these groups, because of their association
with a particular constellation of stars and planets on different
lunar days, which will be given later, become a general-special
type of festival day (parvadinam).
These are the days of special festivities: the first quarter of
the ninth lunar night, or the dark fortnight of [the lunar month
of] Mārgaśīrṣa (November-December); [in the month] of Paușa
(December-January) (the festival occurs at) the dark ninth lunar
midnight; the midnight of Māgha (January-February) (it is at) the
bright lunar fifteenth; at midday [of the month] of Phālguna (Feb-
ruary-March) [it is at the] bright lunar twelfth; of Caitra (March-
April), it is at the bright lunar thirteenth; in [the the month of]
Vaiśākha (April-May) it is the dark eighth of the lunar day; in
Jyaistha (May-June) it is the dark ninth of the lunar day; [in the
:192 TANTRASĀRA
month] of Āsādha (June-July) it is the first day; of Śrāvaṇa (July-
August) it is the previous portion of the day on the dark eleventh;
of Bhadra (August-September) it is the bright sixth lunar mid-
day; of Aśvina (September-October) the bright ninth lunar day; of
Kārtika (October-November) the first portion of the night of the
bright ninth. The star Citra is associated with the moon; the star
Māgha is associated with Jupiter; the star Tişya is associated with
the moon; the star Pūrvaphālguni is associated with Mercury; the
star Śravana, with Mercury; the star Śatabhisa, with the moon;
the star Mula, with the sun; the star Rohini, with Venus; the star
Visakha, with Jupiter; the star Śravana, with the moon. If count-
ing the month Mārgaśīrṣa onward, the number of them becomes
eleven excluding Aśvina, then the parva is special-special.
If any special occasion arises on any other festival day, then
it is called anuparva. If an asterism (a grouping of astronomi-
cal objects) of a star and planet occurs, there is no importance
[concerning the specific] time of the day, for the tithi itself is the
bestower of auspiciousness. The main feature of performing ritu-
als during festival days is the continuity of the performance of the
ritual called. The rituals performed on the festival days should be
given dominance to anuyāga. The words mūrtiyāga and cakra-
yāga are its synonyms. 232
In this ritual, the teacher, his relations along with their sons,
a knower of the truth, a daughter, an outcast woman, a prosti-
tute, a woman who is having her monthly period (aruņā), and
a woman who knows the truth should primarily be worshipped
in cakrayāga. They should be worshipped individually and as a
group. There, the teacher occupies the seat in the center, and cir-
cling him, either in a circle or in a row, beginning with the teacher
and ending with the disciples, following the order of vira and śakti.
Then, they should be worshipped individually with sandalwood
paste, incense, flowers, etc. Then, the vessel should be contem-
plated as Sadaśiva, and, filling it with wine, it should be meditated
upon as the nectar of Śakti. Then, it should be worshipped asTANTRASĀRA 193
Śiva, its enjoying power, and by her [the agent of enjoyment], the
host of deities should be propitiated. Then, meditating on it as a
unity of the triad, composed of the object (nara), the instrument
(śakti), and the supreme subject (Śiva), one should propitiate it in
order to remove the layers of coverings (āvarana). One should
propitiate externally and internally in order to attain both enjoy-
ment and liberation. Then, the propitiation should be done in the
reverse order. Thus, the complete circular movement nourishes
and accomplishes the fullness of cakra. The vessel, in the form of
the universe, should be placed on the base and then, from it, first
propitiating the host of the deities, one should propitiate oneself
with it. In the absence of the vessel one should shape the palm.
of his right hand in the shape of vessel (bhadra), and placing the
palm of the right hand over the left one in such a way that no gaps
are present. This is called vellitaśukti. By the falling of the drops
of wine, the vetāla and guhyaka become pleased, and by the flow
of it Bhairava is pleased.
No person should be given entry into the place of worship. If,
by mistake, [some person] enters there, one should not become
doubtful. If one does become doubtful, then he should perform the
circular ritual twice. After this, fried and pungent food should be
placed abundantly before or inside the sacred house, not known
to common people, and everybody should be made to unite and
be named with term 'deity' (devata), excluding his personal name.
This is the description of vīrasamkarayāga. Then finally they [the
teacher, etc.] should be propitiated with offerings of food, betel,
clothes, etc. This is the principle of mūrtiyāga.
Even a person who has never seen the mandala, by worship-
ping during the days of the festivals (parvadinam) with the murti-
yāga ritual, obtains within a year the result of putraka initiation,
without performing sandhyā and other rituals. This is the pro-
cedure for the elderly, those inclined to worldly enjoyment, and
women. The teacher should give this kind of instruction only when
the descent of grace occurs.194 TANTRASĀRA

The Procedure Called Pavitraka, 233 the Offering of the Sacred
Thread
The ritual 'offering of the sacred thread' (pavitraka) is the ful-
fillment of the command of the Lord preceded by an injunction
such as given in the Śriratnamālā, the Trisiromata, and the
Śrīsiddhāmata. As it is said in the Śrī Tantrāloka: "Without the
'offering of the sacred thread' (pavitraka), everything is fruitless."
Therefore, from the beginning of the lunar bright fortnight of the
month of Āsādha until the end of kularpūrņimā, the full-moon
night of magha, this offering of the pavitraka is to be performed.
In connection with it, on the fifteenth day of the dark night of
Kārtika, kulacakra and nityācakra are to be performed. This is
the opinion of the knowers of the Nitya Tantra. However, accord-
ing to the knowers of the Bhairava Kulormi Tantra, the pavitraka
should be performed on the bright fifteenth night of magha, whileTANTRASĀRA 195
according to the knowers of the Tantra Sadbhāva, it should be
performed on the last fifteenth night of the southern movement of
the sun, that is, the winter solstice (dakșiņāyana).
During that period, one should worship the Lord according
to one's financial capabilities, and performing oblations into the
fire, and then propitiating him, he should offer the pavitraka. The
garland for the pavitraka may be made either of gold, pearl, or
silk thread, cotton thread, or kuśa grass. It may contain knots
representing the thirty-six principles (tattvas). One garland should
be made containing the number of knots of pada, kalā, bhuvana,
• varna, and mantra which reaches to the end of the knee. Another
one should be made to reach to the end of the navel, another to
reach the throat, and another should be on the head. Thus four
pavitrakas should be offered to the deity and to the teacher, while
meditating for the purpose of the fulfillment of the entire path.
One should be given to the remaining members of the group also.
After completing the offering of pavitraka, one should have a
great festival. One should perform the pavitraka for either seven
or three days at the end of the four-month period (between mid-
July and mid-October), or once when there is a state of emer-
gency (an unfortunate event). If one is wealthy, he should perform
the pavitraka every month; otherwise, during the period of four
months as described above, or once. If one is unable to perform
the pavitraka, he should repeat his mantra as atonement. A per-
son who is endowed with right knowledge and possesses riches,
but refrains from the pavitraka, incurs a sin. Being polluted with
greed, although learned, and abstaining from the pavitraka (he)
disgraces knowledge. According to the following statement:
One who corrupts the decrees of the Lord after obtain-
ing right knowledge must perform atonement.
This is the description of the procedure of the pavitraka:
ज्ञानलाभादौ लौकिकोत्सवान्तेऽपि सर्वत्र संविदुल्लासाधिक्यं
देवताचक्रसंनिधिः विशेषतो भवति, इति तथाविधाधिक्यपर्यालोचनया
तथाविधमेव विशेषमनुयागादौ कुर्यात् ।
:196 TANTRASĀRA
On the day of receiving knowledge, and also at the end of
worldly festivals, the upsurge of consciousness becomes exceed-
ingly great. Therefore, the nearness of the host of deities becomes
particularly great. Hence, considering the occurrence of such
upsurge of consciousness, one should perform a specific addi-
tional form of the anuyāga, etc.

The Procedure to Be Followed During the Exposition of the Sacred
Text 234
One should worship the teacher, who is fully endowed with knowl-
edge regarding all sacred texts, and who should be cordially
invited to expound the sacred texts. 235 The teacher should explain
the text to his disciples, or to the disciples of others, according to
their mental development and aptitude. The teacher should explain
the text, even to a person who is established in the lower doctrines,TANTRASARA 197
out of compassion, while his heart is well-disposed with devo-
tional feelings toward the descent of grace caused by the diversity
of the will belonging to the supreme Lord. However, the teacher
should exclude the delicate points of secrets.
As regards the exposition, it is prescribed that the recipient
should be seated on a lower seat than the teacher, and the recipient
should eagerly await receiving the knowledge, having also regu-
lated his speech, mind, and limbs. Only then does the teaching
become fruitful.
At first the ground should be smeared with the sandalwood
paste on which a square should be drawn or imagined. That should
be the base of the lotus; above it, three lotuses should be drawn.
On the middle lotus, the goddess of speech (Vāgīśī), and to the left
and to the right Ganapati and the guru should be worshipped. On
the base lotus, the deity supervising [prevailing over] the subject
explained [in the sacred text] should be worshipped. Then, one
should propitiate the sacred diagram, offering from a water vessel.
This being completed, the teacher should expound the text contain-
ing sūtras, sentences, and the section. The exposition should be
uniform throughout, without contradicting earlier [statements] by
later statements. The teacher should present the view of the oppo-
nent first, and should make use of 'principles of centralization'
(tantra), 'repetition' (āvṛtti), 'extended application' (prasamga),
'figure of speech' (samuccaya), and 'admission of an alternative'
(vikalpa), which are accepted as logical and proper for the presen-
tation of the text. He should represent properly the viewpoint of
the opponent first, and then by refuting it, he should arrive at the
object aimed at by the ascertainment of the meaning of the expo-
sition. He should expound the whole of the section, but not more.
Throughout the exposition, at the end of each subject, propitiation
and worship of the deity should continue until the end of the expo-
sition. Then they should worship the seat of learning, and perform-
ing the ritual for withdrawal, the place should be smeared and all
the material used should be thrown into deep water.198 TANTRASĀRA
This completes the procedure of the 'exposition of the sacred
texts.'

Freedom from Conventional (Samaya) Duties
Although a person steadily established in knowledge does not
require the performance of any rite such as atonement, etc., he
does have the responsibility of showing the right path of conduct
to those who conceive that only by performing rituals will they
attain mokșa. However, a person who is not a knower of the truth,
and whose attainment of mokșa and bhoga are thoroughly depen-
dent on the performance of ritual, transgresses the conventional
rules (samaya) by not performing atonement, and [because of
this] undergoes suffering for one hundred years and becomes an
eater of corpses (pisaca). Therefore, the procedure of the rite of
atonement should be explained. In regard to such person, there is
no atonement for killing a woman. Regarding other forms of sin,
considering the seriousness of the sin, one should repeat, with-
out interruption, goddess malini once or three hundred thousand
times. This he should continue until he becomes free from doubt;
that is, until the feeling of guilt is gone. Then, at the end, the
special worship should be performed; and even on that occasion,
cakrayāga should be performed. Cakrayāga is essentially per-
formed everywhere as the last ritual.
:TANTRASĀRA 199
This is the procedure for the release from convention (samaya).

The Procedure for the Worship of the Spiritual Teacher (Guru) 236
After all the pūjās are completed, and upon the day following the
completion of the cakrayāga, one should then perform gurupūjā.
Previously, the guru has been worshipped as ancillary to the rites,
but now he should be worshipped as the main object of worship.
However, the worship of the teacher not being performed as the
principal object of worship, one remains bound by the bond of
operating the functional rite [one is bound by his own entitlement
performing it]. Therefore, the gurupūjā should be performed in
every respect.
One should first draw the sacred diagram named svāstika, and
should offer a golden seat there. After this, worshipping all the
paths in it, the teacher should be seated upon it, and worshipping
him, one should propitiate him with offering of water, food, and
money. Then, surrendering oneself to him, one offers praise for
the remains of his food, and [after] consuming it, he then pros-200 TANTRASĀRA
trates before the teacher in obeisance, and then should perform
cakrapūjā.
This is the procedure related to the worship of a teacher:
The person who performs the indispensable (nitya) and
occasional observances (naimittika), etc., showing no
misery, attains liberation only by the practice of ritu-
als, without having knowledge of the truth, or taking
recourse to yoga.

Chapter Twenty-One
Thus, all the rituals of the indispensable (nitya) and occasional
observances (naimittika) have been described. Next, the evidence
of this āgama237 will be elaborated. This universe is composed
solely of consciousness, which abides in a consciousness charac-
terized by reflective awareness (vimarsa), which has been ascer-
tained to be its inner verbalization or articulation (śabdana). 238
Śāstra, the sacred text, is of the nature of reflective awarenessTANTRASARA 201
manifesting itself in the form of all substances existing in this uni-
verse, along with the diversity of the relations of deeds and their
results. Therefore, the entire corpus of sacred texts is not differ-
ent from the very nature of the Lord. In reality, it is the giver of
one fruit, but because of the regulating power (niyati) of the Lord,
people are strongly attached to its various divisions for the fulfill-
ment of more than one purpose. Some are strongly inclined to the
Vedas, having the characteristic cognition of duality born of māyā.
Others who are also like them are strongly attached to Samkhya
and Vaişņava doctrines with erroneous notions concerning libera-
tion. Still others are attached to Śaiva Siddhānta, etc., which is, in
essence, the reflective consciousness of the nature of transcendent
Śiva. Others are attached to the Matamga āgamas, etc., which is
characterized by the reflective consciousness of immanent Śiva.
But some, the rarest of the rare, are deeply attached to the doc-
trines of the Trika school, 239 characterized by the reflective con-
sciousness of the nature of the great Lord, free from all limi-
tations, whose highest essence is freedom and bliss, and who is
composed of pure consciousness. Yet others, also forsaking the
former, and also the latter, either leaving it or transcending it,
thus attain the accomplishment of a single purpose by following
only one āgama.

:
Even in dualistic doctrines, it is accepted that all the āgamas,
being the creation of one Lord, are considered to be authorita-
tive. Depending on the validity, in one place non-contradictory
harmony regarding truth with harmony occurs, and as a result one
is inclined to some activity; while thinking that it is not so, one
becomes disinclined. Therefore, they are similar. Mutual opposi-
tion with a difference of subject matter is of no account. Killing a
brahmaņa and the prohibition of it are like the difference between
purity and excellence of the soul. In the absence of samskāra, one
fails to earn the right to follow the code of conduct.
Therefore, the argument is the same for both, like a difference
of āśramas. It is said that the excellence of any action is deter-
mined by the excellence of its fruit, like the Upaniṣadic portion of
the Vedas. 240
If we admit that all the sacred texts (śāstras) were created by
different authors, even then we may suppose that all the śāstras
were created by omniscient authors. This is because the āgamas
are associated with the concepts explained by omniscient authors,TANTRASARA 203
as well as other relevant matters. If the eternality of āgama be sup-
posed, even then the logical arguments, i.e., anvaya and vyatireka,
perception, etc., as well as their validity, are grounded in tradi-
tion (prasiddhi). 241 A notion such as "I see real silver" depends
on somebody else's knowledge, as in this case on a goldsmith's
knowledge.
Therefore, the tradition (prasiddhi) is āgama. To some, it gives
a perceptible result, as, for example, one who is hungry eats. A
child becomes engaged with each individual object only because
of being impelled by prasiddhi, and not by the logical connec-
tion of cause and effect, and its negation. At that age, there is an
absence of logic, etc. Furthermore, at that age, its presence is of
little use. Inference of the logical connection of cause and effect,
and its negation, taking recourse to prasiddhi, are required for the
accomplishment of some action. Some prasiddhis are the givers
of unseen results, such as emancipation after death, dissolution
in prakrti, and emancipation of the soul. Other prasiddhis bestow
similarity with Śiva, while others terminate in the oneness [with
Śiva]. These seen and unseen results are again manifold. There-
fore, in this world full of different traditions (prasiddhis), what-
ever state a person will have in the future, he selects that kind of
prasiddhi and is forced to accept it as something highly desirable
(or undesirable). For this reason, what would be the purpose of
verbal argument in regard to a person who is quite empty? From
among those prasiddhis, one should be taken as valid, and the
validity of that āgama should be accepted. Therefore, a person
should take recourse to whichever āgama grants excellent results.
What could be the purpose of further arguments?
As the wise person considers the light of the conscious-
ness shining as supreme reality, in the same way, he is
aware of self-consciousness. Therefore, one should take
recourse to that holy text which is the essence of the
intuitive light of reflective consciousness characterized
by the all-inclusiveness of anuttara.
:204 TANTRASĀRA
A person exists in the behavior devised by his own con-
viction of common usage, but only becomes free from
doubts when he becomes the supreme Lord, after attain-
ing steadiness in the highest prasiddhi, the transcendent.

Chapter Twenty-Two
The entire worship of this character is now going to be ascertained
according to the Kaula method. This is meant for those who have
attained the proper confidence and in whom the engrained desire
for Kula yāga is going to develop. Therefore, in texts such as the
Yogasamcāra, etc., it has been stated:
Bliss is Brahman which abides in the body. That bliss is
established in a threefold way in the last syllable under
pa-varga that is the labials. The person who is not a
brahmacarin and abstains from the procedure of fol-
lowing the three ma-kāras (that is the ritual involving
the three forbidden elements) is bereft of bliss. Bliss
being bereft of wine, etc., and those who, forsaking
it, engage themselves in worshipping in the cakra in
both ways are cooked in a dreadful hell. Therefore, one
should follow the prescribed procedure.
The Kula form of ritual is to be performed in the following
way. The ritual is sixfold: external, in the sakti, in one's own body,
in the union of the two, in the vital air, and in consciousness.
:206 TANTRASĀRA
Among the six, each latter is more excellent than the former,
but the performance of each former one is based on one's sweet
will. One who is desirous of attaining enjoyment should select
the second, fourth, and fifth; but the sixth is the principal ritual
for the one who is desirous of liberation. Even this kind of person
should perform the rituals beginning from the second, as far as is
possible, during the occasional observances, for in that way the
precept is fulfilled.
Now, in regard to performance of the external ritual, there
is the altar; the vessel full of wine, called the vessel of the vira;
the red cloth; and the Śiva linga, which was described earlier. In
this ritual, without taking recourse to [the ritual] bath, etc., one
attains purity by simply taking repose in the perfect blissful state.
Then, while meditating on the oneness of the vital energy, con-
sciousness, and the body, and [with the awareness that this] con-
sciousness is identical with great Lord, one should repeat the man-
tra twenty-seven times. Then, one should place the mantra (nyāsa)
on the top of the head, the face, the heart, the secret part, and the
mūrtis, first in the natural order, and then in reverse. In this way
the fullness of identity with the great Lord in his āparā, parāparā,
and parā forms is attained.
The number of principles (tattvas) from māyā, puruşa, guņa,
buddhi, to earth principle is twenty-seven. The principles kalā,
etc., are included in it. The vidyāśaktis possess the nature of the
higher-cum-lower aspects. The five Brahmas (Brahmā, Vişņu,
Rudra, Iśvara, and Sadāśiva), Sadyājāta, Bhavodbhavatva, and the
others have twenty-seven aspects. This has been explained by the
venerable, glorious Lakuleśa as well as others.
The great Lord (Parameśvara) possesses five śaktis, even in
its highest aspect, and each of these saktis possesses five aspects.
Thus, the number of saktis is twenty-five. When these saktis are
not shining distinctly as differentiated from each other, they are
then said to be one; that is, a non-differentiated point (anud-
bhinnavibhāgā). With the pervasiveness of the twenty-seven, she
should be meditated on as the flame of consciousness. It repre-TANTRASARA 207
sents the intellect and the vital energy, and it should be tied into
the sacred hair on the head (sikhā) while uttering the mantra once.
It should be thought of as being bound so securely with great Lord
that nothing extraneous can approach it. Then, all the articles for
the ritual, the place of worship, and the guardian deities of the
quarters, which are in front of him, should all be conceived as
being of his essence because they have been permeated by the
whole group of instruments of knowledge dominated by that sort
of intellect [related to the supreme Lord].
Then, the vessel for the offering should be filled with the per-
vasive thought of tying of the sacred hair on the head and should
be worshipped. The altars also are to be worshipped by a few
drops of the liquid uniting the tip of the thumb and the fourth fin-
ger. One should worship the host of mantras located in the cakras
of the body, and should offer oblations to them. The worshipper
should perform this ritual in the vital energy.
Then, on the altar one should draw a seat with the character
of the trident ending in three śaktis representing Parā, Parāparā,
and Aparā. All the principles from earth to the end of māyā are
included in the syllable "sa," and the syllable "au" is to be con-
ceived as the seat of three śaktis. In the syllable "sa," all the prin-
ciples ending in māyā, and in "au," the threefold śaktis are to
be worshipped and [over there] the sakti with the characteristic
of reflective consciousness (vimarśarūpa śakti) should be wor-
shipped. Thus, uttering the mantra (sauh) once, the placement of
it as the base (ādhāra) and the one to be placed over it (ādheya)
should be done. Then, in the consciousness, which is indeed
ādheya, one should conceive this universe in it, which is also com-
posed of consciousness. Thus, this universe is enclosed by means
of consciousness, and by this universe consciousness comes into
being, because this universe has appeared from consciousness and
terminates in it. From the knowable objects, consciousness arises
and gets its rest therein. The reality of the nature of conscious-
ness is arrived at only by means of mutual activity of enclosure
(coitus). Therefore, it has been stated "enclosing all the syllables."208 TANTRASĀRA
Then, one should offer sandal paste, incense, wine, flowers, and
so on, as long as one does not become completely absorbed in the
supreme. Then gaining repose in one's own Self, one should then
throw everything into the water.
This is the procedure of the external form of ritual.

The Procedure in the Sakti (Ritual)
The pair is mutually eager to have the nature of the other. Sakti
likes to have the nature of the vīra, and vīra that of sakti. As both
are of the nature of both, it is shining at the beginning and end-
ing in srsti (coitus), essential for awakening the nature of Śiva
and Śakti in both, which is the function of both. By means of
the restraining power of the Lord, the predominant nature is
normally present in both. This explains the specific center, that
is, the secret parts, which are also designated to be conceived as
śakti. Then, it is worshipped by means of the pervasive thought of
śikhābandha; that is, the tying of the tuft of the hair on the head.
Visarga śakti is to be conceived in the seat ending with three śaktis,
in three corners, and in the center. This is the specific feature of
the concept of pervasion. The same procedure is to be done on the
specific limb of one's body, in that very cakra; then it is done in
the brahmarandhra and in other minor centers.

The Procedure Regarding the Pair (Yāmala)
The characteristic feature of the sakti is [in its being] that by
which perfect steadiness of nonduality is attained. Therefore,
without considering age, caste, worldly and otherworldly spiritual
relations, one attains supreme identity of nonduality born of both
[male and female] (1).
The saktis are of three types: the created, the caused, and the born
of the union of both. They are conceived otherwise by subsidiary
divisions. They are mutually worshipped and propitiated because
bliss is adjacent there (2).
The [principal] cakra should be properly worshipped. Other minor
cakras should be worshipped after that. The external worship is
to be performed by the offering of flowers, sandal paste, etc., and
inwardly they are to be propitiated by means of offering food,
wine, etc. (3).
:
:
Thus, the upsurge of the mass of bliss becomes manifest by means
of various activities and, as a result, all the minor cakras, being
dissolved in the principal cakra, become identified with it (4).
All of the minor cakras attain the fullness of enjoyment by means
of enjoying their respective spheres [of enjoyment], and as a
result they relish their own nature. Thus, all the deities of minor
cakras become centrally inclined to the principal cakra of con-
sciousness (5).
When the fullness of the rays, characterized by the host of the
deities of the minor cakras, bring about vigor to both the sakti
and the possessor of śakti, they both become exceedingly inclined
toward each other (6).
[At the time of union] of the pair, while they enter the highest
abode of bliss, the agitation born of its vibration agitates the minor
cakras as well, and they should be conceived as identical with it
because they are not distinct from it (7).TANTRASARA 211
Thus when, by means of the comparative development of balance,
this pair loses all distinctions, which is difficult to express in
words, then that consciousness is known as the compact unity of
the emission of both (8).
That steady abode of anuttara, the beyond, is characteristic of both;
that is, transcendent and immanent, which is otherwise designated
as the lofty, all-inclusive universal bliss. This is neither the state
of tranquility, or ever-restfulness, nor the state of rising, but is
called the highest Kaula, the cause of the rest and the act of rising.
The one who is desirous of the attainment of the non-limited
nature of the Self should make himself identical with conscious-
ness. It is true that both, with the characteristics of resting and
rising regarding the sakti and the possessor of śakti, rise simulta-
neously (9-10).
On account of the mutual absorption of both, the very nature
of the Self, both are of the characteristics of resting and rising,
because both have the characteristics of both. However, it is the
śakti who bears the rising of creation in her womb, but not the one
who is the possessor of the sakti (11).
In this śakti, the Kula, which is embodied in the teacher, should
be transmitted into the śakti, and through her, because of the close
union which emanates by the mutual contact of both [should be
collected] and distributed among the people (11a).
Therefore, in this twofold creation of rest and rising, those who
concentrate on the former, the state of visarga and that it is the
cause of both (that is, those who reflect that everything is the
expansion of visarga), they become steadily rested in the perfect
state free from all limitations (11b-12a).
That which rises from the mutual union of both should be col-
lected externally from the principal mouth. Worship with it will
satisfy the host of deities, and it will be the bestower of attain-
ments and liberation (12b-13a).
:212 TANTRASĀRA
By the practice of visarga with the nature of rest, the restful [state
of] Śivahood is attained, and also the host of deities shines with
the same nature. At that very state, the rising of the absolute void
occurs, which is devoid of bliss (nirānandamaya). It is free from
modality, not only of the abode, but also of others (13b-14a).
By the delightful tasting of the external object, by which one's
own blissful nature is filled, and not only by this, but also by the
inner organs which are taking delight from tasting the delightful
object, the nature of one's own and, by this process [of the tasting
delight and experience of fullness one's own self], the perfect state
of the inner search of this experience adds to the delightful nature
of the minor cakras and, from there, to the main ones (15b-16a).
This threefold visarga conforms to its meaning. It is full in every
respect, from where everything is created, from where this mani-
fold remains present, and where creation is dissolved. In this
description of visarga above, which is threefold, mantravīrya
being continuously reflected upon in its threefold form, the true
potency of mantra is then attained. Thus, in mantravīrya, which
is the inner core of consciousness, the mantra [abiding there] gives
birth to various results (16b-17).
In the middle of the triangle, there exists an ever-blooming lotus
veiling the mandala. In its center is a stalk having a lotus with six-
teen petals, with a root inseparably attached to it. In the course of
the friction of the two lotuses having a stalk attached to each, the
host of kalās lying within the moon, perfectly full and charming,
and those lying within the sun, and by the association with blood
and semen related to the three-petalled lotus, the creation of the
sprout representing fire occurs (18-20a).
Thus, taking recourse to the mudrā representing the moon, the
sun, and fire (known as samgatta mudrā), one who has inter-
nalized the sequence of creation, etc., in his heart, regarding
the sequence of creation, etc., quickly attains the fourth state
(anākhyā) (20b-21a).
:TANTRASĀRA 213
In consequence of the absorption in the khecari mudrā of both the
śakti and the possessor of śakti, or, in other words, when perfect
equilibrium of both occurs, whatever experience comes about in
the enjoyment of drink, sport, and fun merges in vimarśa follow-
ing the course of unmanifest (avyakta), dhvani, rava, sphoța, śruti,
nāda, nādānta; remains as anāhata without any break; and finally
becomes the virile energy of the mantra (mantravīrya) (21b-23a).
[The cakras are eight:] the outgoing and ingoing of the vital air at
the time of their cessation; in the ear while hearing a sound; in the
eye while perceiving an object; the coming in contact of both the
sexual organs; during their union; at the end of twelve; and in the
yāmala (23b-24a):
From the middle of the breast to the end of the lips the unmanifest
sound exists, abiding in the throat; one who listens to it inside
both the cakras at the time of the cessation of agitation where all
have their rest, that is, nādabhairava, the Absolute having eight-
fold forms, that is, ardhacandra, nāda, śakti representing jyoti,
dhvani, samaratthis is stated to be the absolute extension of the
mantra (24b-26).
Thus, calling up the above extension in the mind in every act, and
in whatever it may be, one remains nonattached while living and
becomes absolute Bhairava (27).
The place where the void and the nonvoid dissolve is the middle
path in the form of a shaft where the fire and air have dissolved in
the equilibrium of the trident. This is to be meditated upon in such
a way as fluid that has gone to rest in the fluid (28).
Remaining steady in firm conviction without allowing any doubt
to rise, one should continue contemplating, "I am not," and should
get oneself free from the bondage of ācāra, witnessing the host of
divinities in the body, merging pleasure and worries in the mass
of consciousness, and all the time viewing the recipient of them
which abides in the centers of the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose and
other centers. In this way khecarī is certainly attained (29-30).214 TANTRASĀRA
When getting one's body placed in a distant sky and instanta-
neously following the sahasamudra, contracting both the hands
gets it to fall, while one remains looking below. This mudrā turns
into vyomacarī (31).
Here ends the description of the ritual named yāmala.
उक्तव्याप्तिके प्राणे विश्वमये प्रोक्तसंविद्व्याप्त्या तर्पणान्नगन्धधूपादिसमर्पणेन

:
कृतिस्तत्रभवच्छ्रीमन्महामहेश्वराचार्यवर्य श्रीमदभिनवगुप्तापादानाम् ।।
Thus, in the vital air with the characteristic of such an exten-
sion of immanence, one should associate it with consciousness,
and then with the association of samvid, the offering of tarpaņa,
food, sandal paste, incense, etc., one should be made steady.
This is the ritual regarding the vital air. The ritual in the form
of samvid has been discussed earlier in regard to one who has
attained steadiness in it. After performing one of the rituals
among them, if the disciple becomes free from doubts and attains
purity of the heart, then showing him the ritual without taking
recourse to offering sesame and clarified butter into the fire, and
so on, he should be given initiation only by mere glance while
keeping in his heart the aforesaid permeating extension (vyāpti).
From the initiation given in absence to the end of the occasional
ritual, the above procedures are to be followed, but they are to be
performed keeping this as the principal ritual. The seven forms of
kulayāga are performed in the body of the spiritual teacher, but
when this is performed once along with the aforesaid ritual, every-
thing becomes perfect. Thus may the end be auspicious.
This is a work of revered Abhinavaguptapāda ācārya.
:Notes
Chapter One
1. Like ignorance, knowledge is also of two types. That knowledge
called pauruşa is free from thought constructs (vikalpa) and is of
the nature of pure I-Consciousness. It shines in its fullness when
complete identification with Śiva occurs. That ignorance, which is
also called paurușa, is composed of vikalpas, which are contrary
to the perfect light of consciousness on account of their being lim-
ited. This imperfect knowledge (apūrņa jñāna) is the root cause of
worldly existence. When that ignorance called pauruşa disappears
as a result of initiation, the impurity born of past deeds, which are
the cause of the body, still persists. For this reason, the knowledge
of the Self (purusa) fails to shine forth. Defilement (mala) called
kārmamala is of the nature of prārabdha, the impressions of past
deeds that will be experienced in this body. On the complete extinc-
tion of prārabdha, the body falls off, after which the paurușa type
of knowledge becomes manifest. The order is as follows: initiation,
destruction of the pauruşa form of ignorance, competency to study
āgama texts, emergence of the bauddha form of knowledge, libera-
tion while living, destruction of prārabdha, the fall of the body,
and the emergence of the pauruşa kind of knowledge and the
attainment of one's own nature.
2. Although apparently distinct from consciousness, thought con-
structs (vikalpas) are not different from it. When, through right
reasoning (sattarka) the purification of vikalpas takes place, then
one arrives at the state where vikalpas merge back into their source,
which is indeterminate (avikalpa) by nature. This process of purifi-
cation of vikalpas is described in Chapter Four.
215
:216 NOTES
3. The descent of sacred texts (sāstra) occurs through five currents,
known as consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action, repre-
senting five faces of Śiva. These are the five saktis of the Lord
and are connected with the faces of Isana, Tatpuruşa, Sadyojāta,
Vāmadeva, and Aghora, respectively. Among the holy texts
(āgamas), some are predominantly dualistic, some are dual-cum-
nondual, and some are perfectly nondual. The number of dualistic
āgamas is ten, while those which preach the doctrine of duality-
cum-nonduality are eighteen in number, and those whose view is
perfectly nondual are sixty-four in number.
4. The compound word svabhāvaḥ (svasya bhāvaḥ) denotes the funda-
mental reality of one's own nature which is identical with con-
sciousness.
5. The undivided, eternal, and ever-present light (prakāśa) is also
represented by the technical term spanda or 'vibration,' a con-
scious throb that goes on vibrating, and illuminates everything else
in this universe.
:
6. The word nirākāra means 'without any form'; however, in this con-
text nirākāra should be understood to mean 'that light is not of any
specific form because it is of all forms.'
7. This is the reference to the descending and ascending arcs of con-
sciousness. The descending arc is the unfoldment of consciousness
which brings the universe, and all limited beings, into existence.
The ascending arc refers to the yogic process which brings a lim-
ited consciousness to its fullness; that is, a limited knowing subject
is elevated to its original source.
8. The 'means' (upāya) are a door which allows the practitioner to
enter the inner sanctum of Śiva. This entrance or absorption is
technically called āveśa. A bound being is limited and therefore
devoid of freedom, thus a human being is incapable of conceiving
its own real nature. When this limitation disappears by the 'means'
(upāya), the state of identity with the Absolute that occurs is known
as absorption (samāveśa). This absorption is fourfold: born of
Śambhu or Śiva (śāmbhava), born of Śakti (śākta), and born of aņu
(āņava). The fourth type of samāveśa referred to in the text is the
absorption brought about by anupāya.NOTES 217
9. The upāyas are the 'means' to attain the supreme end of human life.
Upāya is the means and upāya is the 'end,' which is Paramaśiva,
the supreme Lord. Some of the means help to obtain that end
(upeya) directly, while others lead to increasingly subtle states of
being until the aspirant is able to intuitively realize that the
supreme is not merely attained by entering some mental state
through upāya. All the means serve some purpose: āņava merges
into śakta, and śakta merges into śāmbhava. Upon attaining the
śāmbhava upāya, one merges into the non-sequential 'intuitive
knowledge' (pratibhā) characterized by that self-effulgent light
(prakasa). These means are relatively distinct because of grada-
tions in the intensity of the 'descent of grace' (saktipāta); that is,
the intensity of contact with the grace of the Lord. The degree of
grace one receives varies with the preparedness of the person.
When the grace is supremely intense, the person does not take
recourse to any sort of spiritual practice or meditation. He sees and
realizes that the entire universe continuously emerges and dissolves
within the core of his heart.
:
10. The whole text of the Tantrāloka and its short version, the Tan-
trasāra, are elaborations on the subject of these four means. The
exposition in the both texts begins with Chapter Two, in which
Abhinavagupta describes the nature of anupāya.
Chapter Two
11. The term anupaya refers to the attainment of identity with Śiva
without the application of any means.
Chapter Three
12. The perfect Absolute is in reality partless and full; it should be
meditated upon as orbicular and without any parts. This reality
shines to the yogin who has attained 'absorption without taking
recourse to any means' (anupāya), as a mass of the fire of con-
sciousness into which all beings enter to be consumed. The yogin
experiences freedom from pleasure, pain, doubts, and determinate
knowledge (vikalpa), and is finally absorbed in the highest 'indeter-
minate state' (nirvikalpa).

218 NOTES
13. The 'autonomous energy' of the Lord is known as icchāśakti, which
is inseparable from the Lord. The essence of the Lord is light
(prakāśa), which by its free will manifests the multitude of cre-
ations and dissolutions. The entire picture of the universe shines on
the screen of one's own consciousness, inseparable from the Self.
14. The absolute light is known as the void of consciousness and likened
to a mirror. By means of its freedom (svatantrya) the entire uni-
verse manifests as a reflection in a mirror. The reflected objects are
apprehended according to the cleanliness or purity of the mirror.
All objects of the universe shine in it, along with all of their indi-
vidual distinctions. The different sense organs and mind are also
described as mirrors and their reflections possess specific charac-:
teristics which are perceived according to the comparative purity of
their surface. For example, a mirror, clear water, or the retina of
the eye can reflect a form or color, while the sexual organ is capa-
ble of reflecting only touch, and so on. However, the light of con-
sciousness is capable of displaying all sorts of reflections.
15. The principles of original taste, touch, etc., shine in the Lord and
are inseparable from him. However, on the empirical level they
become manifest as reflections. Even then, they remain in contact
with the original (bimba). Otherwise, the chain reactions as
referred to in the text would not be possible.
16. That power called citśakti is of the nature of singular, self-con-
scious light (prakāśa). The insentient objects which shine in our
senses are also composed of light. However, we are unable to per-
ceive them as sentient because they lack an awareness that "I am
sentient." In contrast, the knowing subject, although remaining
limited, is aware that he or she exists, and is capable of consciously
reflecting on this self-aware existence.
17. This universe is perceived as possessing two aspects: first, its relation
with speech, specifically the sounds that denote meaning; and sec-
ond, the entity denoted by speech or sound. The former is known as
parāmarśa and the latter parāmarśanīya, literally 'that is denoted
by sound.' In addition, there is a supreme form of speech that is
inseparably associated with Lord called paranāda or parā vāk.NOTES 219
18. The Lord is associated with three principal energies (śakti) called
anuttara, icchā, and unmeșa, represented by the three phonemes
"a," "i," and "u," respectively. Each phoneme has two aspects: a
short and a long measure. The corresponding long forms are known
as ānanda, īśana, and ūrmi. This tradition states that the short
vowels are predominantly of the nature of light (prakāśa), there-
fore, they have the characteristic of the sun; the corresponding long
vowels, having the nature of repose, are considered to be of the
nature of the moon.
19. The syllable "a" has another "a" as its corresponding phoneme. The
one represents Śiva and the other Śakti. The vibrative union of both
gives rise to bliss (ananda), representing the phoneme. "ā." It is
from the energy of ānanda śakti that the universe comes into being,
which in short are all the remaining phonemes beginning with
icchā and ending in “kșa.” This union of "a" and "a" is character-
ized by consciousness alone, while pratyavamarśaņa, the cognitive
desire to create sisṛkṣātmā, is known as the energy of will. This
desire representing will (icchā) is the desire to get back to bliss that
has been as if lost.
20. Icchā, īśana, unmeșa, and ūrmi represent the energy of will and the
energy of knowledge, respectively. The energy of action does not
exist in any form either manifest or unmanifest up to this level of
unfoldment. When activity shows itself, only then four neuter pho-
nemes, which are "r," "ri," "!," and "!," appear. They are similar
in nature to that of "r" and "l" belonging to the group of consonants.
21. Four phonemes, namely "e," "ai," "o," and "au," represent the
energy of action. When the movement of the supreme vibration
becomes completely externalized, then it is known as "au," in
which the flow of the unfoldment stops. Then all the divisions of
the energy merge in the one which shows itself as the bindu or drop.
22. Bindu is the compact mass of consciousness assembled into an undif-
ferentiated point from which the creation of the universe proceeds.
23. On its way of unfolding the universe, the akulaśakti belonging to
Śiva first manifests bindu represented by one dot. Further, out of
bindu, the kaulikī visarga śakti emerges in the form of two dots,220 NOTES
one above the other. It is from this sakti that the creation of the
entire universe takes place.
24. Emission (visarga) is threefold, i.e., āņava, śākta, and śāmbhava.
They are characterized by difference, difference-cum-nondifference,
and nondifference. The picture in the form of āņavavisarga shines
to the view of the limited subject as "this." In this view, on the one
end lies the limited subject and on the other lies the universe. These
two get merged into the unity of limited knowledge and its object,
which is nothing but the unity of knowingness (citi) and the object
of knowledge (cetya). This is known as visarga, where repose
occurs in the heart. In the second visarga, known as cittasam-
bodha, the entire universe-while shining as one with conscious-.
ness with all the distinctions of subjects and their objects-yet also
shines, transcending them all. The third visarga is known as the
dissolution of citta (cittapralaya) when all the distinctions of know-
ing subjects and objects are obliterated, and therefore shines as one
with the subject of supreme consciousness.
25. The energy of emission (visarga) manifesting itself as individual cog-
nitions appears as the universe. She, that is, Śakti, is the cause, or
the mother, of all sorts of gross words and sentences. In āgamas it
has two appellations; the one is called mātṛkā and the other mālinī.
The former is the seed (bija) and the latter is the recipient (yoni) of
the seed. The one, when agitated, gives birth to diverse phonemes.
All these phonemes, being the indicative sound, represent all thirty-
six principles (tattva), beginning with Śiva and ending with the earth.
26. In reality the number of cognitions is six. They are anuttara, icchā,
unmeșa, ānanda, īśana, and ürmi. However, because of expansion
and reverse movement the number becomes twelve. When anuttara
proceeds to expand it becomes "ā." Similarly, “i” becomes "i" and
“u” becomes "ū.” This movement is called prasaraņa. At the same
time, mutual relation of "a" with "i," "a" with "u," "i" with "a,"
"u" with "a," "a" with bindu, and “a” with visarga occurs. It is then
known as pratisamcaraņa. Thus the phonemes which come into
being following the above methods are of mixed character. They
make the fullness of the Lord.NOTES 221
27. The number of Kālikās is twelve. They are called Kālikās because
they cause change through the process of mutation denoted by the
word kalana. Cognition is nothing but the energy of the Lord on the
pure level of consciousness. However, with emergence of māyā,
differentiation sets in, with the result that reflective cognition
(parāmarśa) descends down to the worldly level and assumes the
character of syllables on the one hand and the principles (tattva) on
the other.
28. There are four levels of speech. They are parā, paśyanti, madhy-
amā, and vaikhari. For detailed account on the subject of four lev-
els of speech see Abhinavagupta's Parātrīśikā Vivaraņa. See also
Padoux's Vāc: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras.
29. Even on the level māyā these phonemes can possibly be enlivened by
contact with pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā) through which they can
be utilized to serve the purpose of both enjoyment and liberation.
30. Pure absorption into Śiva (sāmbhava samāveśa) signifies pure con-
sciousness. When a yogin attains it, he realizes that all the six paths
(şadadhvas) are not different from his own Self. They reflect in his
own consciousness, rise in his very Self, and gain their rest in it. In
the integrated unitary consciousness, creation, maintenance, and
dissolution shine inseparably from one's own nature.
31. If one is capable of merging his consciousness into the pure light of
absolute consciousness through śāmbhava upāya, then assiduous
tasks, such as bathing, religious observances (vrata), purification
of the body, meditation, recitation of sacred syllables (mantras),
sacrifice, or oblation into the fire are not required.
Chapter Four
32. The thought constructs (vikalpa) are of two types, pure and impure.
The pure vikalpa, though being a vikalpa, is an aid in achieving the
highest aim of human life, liberation (mokşa). On the other hand,
the impure vikalpa entices beings with worldly existence. It is
because of its existence that the Self conceives itself as limited in
knowledge and action.222 NOTES
33. The imposition on the innate nature (svabhāva) of different kind of
pure properties is known as purification (samskāra). The very
nature of consciousness is its freedom from thought constructs
(vikalpa). This indeterminate nature of consciousness (nirvikalpa)
is also the very nature of the Self. This is known as innate nature
(svabhāva). Listening to this nature of the Self repeatedly, thinking
of it, and meditating on it continuously help the thought construct
to become purified. In the beginning, the layers of pure thought
(śuddha-vikalpa) remain as if indistinct. However, in the long run,
through practice, the layers of pure thought become perfectly dis-
tinct. It is important to emphasize here that the perfect purity of
one's own innate nature (svabhāva) is revealed by pure thought
constructs (śuddha-vikalpa) when the latent impressions of duality
are removed. At this stage the vikalpas do not stand as the cause of
the duality. With the purification of vikalpas, in the right manner,
consciousness shines forth with all its glory.
34. The erroneous conception latent in the soul, "I am in bondage," is
the root cause of worldly existence.
35. That deep-rooted impression of the soul, “I am in bondage," is
uprooted by the conviction contrary to it, i.e., the pure thought con-
struct (śuddha-vikalpa).
36. The right form of reasoning (sattarka) does not arise in the soul on
account of descent of grace in a lesser degree of intensity. The right
form of reasoning begins to show as a result of study of āgamas and
instruction by a teacher.
37. The study of agama gives rise to the series of thought constructs
free from doubt, which in turn give rise to the series of pure
thought constructs (śuddha-vikalpa). This is the characteristic of
the right form of reasoning. This right reasoning is called bhāvanā,
the layers of pure thought. It is like the wish-fulfilling cow which
grants all desires. According to this system, intuitive reasoning
(sattarka) is considered to be the most supreme limb of yoga. By
the right application of it, one becomes the true knower of the
nature of reality. It is by this means alone that one is able to discern
right from wrong.NOTES 223
38. The five under the group of self-restraint (yama) are: nonviolence,
truthfulness, not stealing, restraining one's sexual urge, and nonac-
ceptance of gifts. They are not considered to be the direct aid in
attainment of consciousness. This is because the real nature of con-
sciousness which is Śiva is not touched by any of these means.
39. Withdrawal of senses from the external objects and placing them in
one's heart is known as pratyāhārā. However, for the consciousness
which is all-pervasive, withdrawal is not possible. In the same way,
concentration, meditation, and absorption (samādhi) are related to
something which is limited. Therefore, they do not serve any pur-
pose in attainment of the vision of that which is by nature unlimited.
40. Practice is an activity which is performed consciously either in the
vital energy, in the intellect, or in the body, etc. Lifting heavy
loads, studying a text and continuous effort to understand its mean-
ing, occupying oneself with dancing and music add confidence and
later proficiency to the respective spheres. However, consciousness,
having the nature of light, is ever shining and changeless. There-
fore, practice does not add or take away anything from it.
41. The universe is the sportive play of three energies (śaktis). The first
is the supreme energy in which all the principles (tattvas) from Śiva
to the earth shine as pure consciousness, free from all determinate
knowledge (nirvikalpa). The second, known as Śrīparāparā śakti,
by which everything shines as different-cum-nondifferent like the
reflection of the elephant in the mirror. Though the reflection is
one with the mirror, yet, as in the case of the elephant, it is distinct
from the mirror itself. The third power, named Āparāśakti, is the
one by which everything under the domain of the delusive power of
māyā shines with difference. There is yet another energy (śakti)
which abides in everything, permeating and threading through all,
which is known as Mātrsādbhāva, Kālakarșiņī, and other similar
names. Each of the above-mentioned śaktis, following the order of
creation, maintenance, and dissolution, possesses three aspects.
Therefore the number becomes twelve.
42. Knowingness (pramiti) which abides in all the knowers is the active
principle. It is known as existing awareness (mātṛsādbhāva).224 NOTES
43. By the power of Kālakarșiņi, complete shrinkage of time occurs. As
a result, the sequence of time completely disappears, which reveals
consciousness in its totality.
44. When supreme consciousness, which is the knowing subject, con-
sumes all differences, it is known as fire. In reality, being of the
nature of I-Consciousness, it assumes by its power of autonomy the
forms of intellect, the mind, and ten senses. Thus the number
becomes twelve. The knowing subject (pramātā), who is of the
nature of fire, assuming the nature of an instrument of knowledge,
becomes known as the sun. At that state it is known as ego
(ahaṁkāra). The state which is known to be the instrument of
knowledge is-in reality the eternal aspect of the knowing subject.
Now the question regarding the creation of the knowables arises.
The instrument of knowledge cannot be designated as such without
the existence of any knowable object. Therefore, the instrument of
knowledge itself assumes the nature of the objective universe. From
the level of the knowing subject (pramātā), down to the level of the
object, they assume four aspects each. These four aspects are cre-
ation, maintenance, dissolution, and the nameless (anākhyā). The
total number of the aspects is twelve. As these aspects are manifes-
tation of consciousness, the yogin, while wandering along in the
void of consciousness, can easily attain steadiness in any of these
states and attain absorption by unifying these four states.
45. The term kalana has different meanings. Kālī is the conscious agent
who performs kalana, therefore she is known as Kālī. The number
of Kālīs is twelve. They are as follows: (1) Sṛṣṭikālī, (2) Sthiti Kālī,
(3) Samhārakālī, (4) Raktakālī, (5) Svakālī (sukālī), (6) Yama Kālī,
(7) Mṛtyukālī, (8) Rudrakālī (Bhadrakālī), (9) Paramārkakālī, (10)
Mārtaņdakālī, (11) Kālāgnirudrakālī, and (12) Mahākālī (Parākālī,
Mahākālakālī, Kālakālī). This kalana also occurs in relation to the
knowable, the instrument of knowledge, and the knowing subject.
As each state is of the characteristic of creation, maintenance, dis-
solution, and the nameless one (anākhyā), the number of the divine
energies also becomes twelve.
46. Here the word Maheśvara does not refer to the highest Lord of this
system but to one of the triad, Brahmā, Vişņu, and Maheśvara.NOTES 225
47. For example, while performing yāga one can one day offer flowers
to the Lord. Then, next day, the one may offer sandal paste, food,
etc., until finally one is able to offer oneself.
48. Śrīpūrva is another name for the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra.
Chapter Five
49. The term "bound soul" (paśu), which literally means animal, is a
technical term of this system. With the appearance of limitation,
the soul, which is essentially composed of pure consciousness,
finds itself limited in knowledge and action. Its innate nature
becomes as if veiled, for which reason it becomes known as atomic
(aņu). At this level of existence the bonded souls are of great vari-
ety because they receive the grace of the Lord, which is based on
comparative distinctions of intensity. The right form of intuitive
judgment does not arise in all. Therefore, they have to depend on
āgama for the rise of that intuitive knowledge. At this stage, there
is a need for a spiritual guide. A spiritual guide is a person meant
to lead the seeker in selecting an appropriate āgama for him to
study. When the āgama is studied properly, pure thought (śuddha-
vikalpa) arises. However, in the case of those who lack right under-
standing, purification of thoughts (vikalpas) in this particular way
is not possible. Therefore, they need to rely on other means for that
purification of thoughts (vikalpas). In short, these means are: medi-
tation, taking recourse to the vital energy (prāņa), and making the
body the instrument of knowledge as a means to attain one's ends.
The body itself is a gross instrument for the attainment of the high-
est aim of life. For those who are steadily convinced that a body is
the Self, it becomes a suitable means.
50. Meditation is performed by the intellect (buddhi). This kind of
practice is fruitful for those who think that intellect is the Self. On
the other hand, those who are convinced that the vital air (prāņa) is
the Self make the prāņa a means. In order to remove vikalpas, the
aspirant makes use of body (karaņa), mudrā, and different sorts of
āsanas.
51. Vital energy is of two types, one general and the other particular.
The particular form of the vital air manifests itself in five different226 NOTES
ways. They are known as prāņa, apāna, samāna, udāna, and
vyāna. These particular forms of vital energy, although manifested
distinctly in these five ways and functioning in different parts of
the body, are basically resting in the general form of vital air. Their
basic nature is to 'move forward' (uccāraṇa). The general prāņa is
known as vibration (spanda), pulsation, blossoming, etc. At the
start of the creative impulse, after manifestation of void, the con-
sciousness assumes the nature of vital energy.
52. Karaņa is a particular type of aņava upaya which relates to the
meditation on the body, etc.
53. The supreme consciousness is self-luminous by nature. It is only
because of its autonomy that it takes on the nature of everything. In
other words, we can say that it shines in multifarious forms. One
should meditate in the core of one's heart because the heart is the
essence of all the principles, which abide closest to the heart. First
of all the aspirant should meditate with concentration on the uni-
flavoredness (sāmarasya) of prāņa, apāna, and udāna, represent-
ing the moon, the sun, and the fire. This meditation is to be per-
formed by stopping the outgoing and ingoing movement of vital air
in such a way that prāņa, apāna, and udāna, after giving up the
functioning in their respective manners, become one, leaving out
all distinctions. As fire blazes up with the churning process of
araņi, in a similar way, the opposing movement of both prāņa and
apāna, being stopped, enters into the current in the middle path,
which transforms it into the fire of udāna, known as the great ter-
rible fire blazing upward. This fire is known as the great fire
because it consumes the limitedness of the conscious subject, its
object, and its instrument of knowledge. Thus, with attaining per-
fection in such meditation, the meditator becomes free from all
limitations and then he makes an effort to attain oneness with the
highest subject.
54. The highest subject is supposed to be encircled with twelve energies.
They are associated with creation, maintenance, dissolution, and
the fourth one designated as nameless (anākhyā). This nameless
one, being without limitations, is associated with each of the other
three. Therefore the number becomes twelve. They are as follows:
:NOTES 227
(a) srsti-srsti, srști-sthiti, srsti-samhāra, srști-anākhyā (b) sthiti-
srști, sthiti-sthiti, sthiti-samhāra, sthiti-anākhyā (c) samhāra-srști,
samhāra-sthiti, samhāra-samhāra, samhāra-anākhyā.
55. The transcendent wheel (anuttara cakra) consisting of twelvefold
nature, going outside through the outlets of the eye, etc., assumes
the nature of the object. This object is characterized by the moon;
the sense organs, representing the sun, are the instrument of
knowledge (pramāņa); while the knowing subject is the fire.
56. After the destruction of all the objects, they remain existent in the
form of residual traces. Therefore, they should also be placed into.
the flames of the fire of consciousness.
57. While giving exposition of the mystery of uccāra related to the
movement of the vital energy, the author states that due to this
movement an unmanifest sound becomes manifest. This unmani-
fest sound is called unstruck sound (anāhata). Before the rise of
prāņa, the aspirant causes it for a moment to rest in his heart.
58. By the term void (śūnya) negation is meant. This is the state of dis-
solution of all objects. The heart is known as the void where nonex-
istence of any positive entity is possible. It is essentially of the
nature of consciousness where bliss, the essence of it, remains per-
fectly blossoming. It is because of this nature that it is called innate
blissfulness (nijānanda). The experiencing subject feels it as the
very nature of the Self. With direct vision of one's own nature this
blissfulness becomes manifest.
59. At this level, as there is no existence of objectivity in any way, the
experience of the delight that occurs there is called nirānanda.
Then the energy of consciousness, after making the void manifest,
assumes the nature of vital energy, which possesses dual form. On
the one hand, prāņa is insentient, and on the other it is sentient, for
the Lord has made it distinct from other insentient objects by
bestowing sentiency on it and has made it the experiencing subject.
It experiences the bliss of its own (nijānanda), however, as the
experiencing subject proceeds along the knowable objects touching
the instrument of knowledge. In other words, when it becomes
slightly inclined toward externality, then the bliss which remains228 NOTES
associated with it is known as nirānanda. This is because it loses
the earlier nature of blissfulness belonging to the experiencing sub-
ject alone.
60. Parānanda literally means the bliss belonging to the other. With
the rise of the knowable, which occurs along with the rise of apāņa,
distinction or otherness shows itself. Therefore, the bliss that
becomes manifest, at this stage, does not belong to the Self but to
something distinct from it. It is for this reason that it is called
parānanda.
61. On the level of samāna all the knowables become intermixed with
one another and show themselves as the unity of all. The delight
that develops as a result of this is highly extensive and nourishing.
It is for this reason that a yogin experiences this particular kind of
bliss as brahmānanda.
:
62. The number of the movements of the inhalation and exhalation is
21,600 during the period of 24 hours. When the yogin is able to
dissolve the inhaling and exhaling breaths in the middle current
(madhya marga), only then the vital air known as prāņa transforms
itself and becomes udāna. When one is able to rest there, one expe-
riences bliss abiding in the experiencing subject, which is quite dis-
tinct from nijānanda and other types of bliss. It is called
mahānanda because of its greatness.
63. After one attains and experiences mahānanda, one advances fur-
ther and as a result of the rise of vyāna, the great all-pervasive one,
one experiences bliss free from all accidental attributes. This type
of bliss is known as bliss of consciousness (cidānanda).
64. Some technical terms connected with the concept of repose
(viśrāntī) are known as pragānada, udbhava, kampa, nidrā, and
ghūrņi. Their meanings are as follows: when the yogin utilizes the
means related to the body to attain the highest reality, he experi-
ences a sort of delight which is the result of his intention toward
fullness (pūrṇatā). The emergence of delight occurs only at his
contact with fullness. When the yogin remains absorbed in that
delightful state (even for moment), his firm conviction regarding
his identity with body is severed as if with the flash of light of con-
:NOTES 229
sciousness. Then he experiences a sudden "upward movement"
known as "a jump upward" (udbhava). This takes place because the
pull in the opposite direction becomes absent. As all the bonds
functioning in the lower regions are cut off by the light, this upper
pull leads the aspirant to feel and attain his own innate potency, the
energy of which cuts off all the bonds of ignorance. This state is
technically known as kampa, which literally means shaking. Then
the state that follows is called nidrā. At this state all external sense
organs cease to function, and even the internal ones stop to func-
tion properly. Hence he feels a kind of slumber which is a tempo-
rary state, for when he attains steadiness in pure consciousness, he
experiences the immanence of consciousness and is able to realize.
that all, whatever that might be, is, in essence, consciousness. With
this direct realization he wanders or whirls (ghurnate), that is,
arrives at the state of vibrate consciousness, until finally the state
of great pervasiveness (mahāvyāpti) begins to shine forth. The
effect of this is that his ignorance, which is his firm conviction in
the form of conceiving the nonself as the self, is destroyed first.
This is followed by the destruction of the conviction of conceiving
the self as nonself. Finally, the yogin directly realizes the true
nature of the Self.
65. The five states like waking, etc., are related to the triangle centrally
located in the mūlādhāra, where the delight is experienced. The
bulb is the location of udbhāva, kampa is experienced in the heart,
the palate is the place of the sleep (nidrā), while the whirl (ghūrņi)
is experienced at the 'end of twelve' (dvādaśānta).
66. The absolute state of the heart of repose which is attained through
uccāra is technically known as unmanifest [linga]. This linga is of
three types, i.e., avyakta, vyaktāvyakta, and vyakta. Avyakta linga
is characterized by absorption (līnam) where everything loses its
individuality. However, it is only experienced while one remains
unified with it. It is this state from which the universe emerges and
where it finally goes to rest. The manifested-unmanifested (vyaktā-
vyakta) form of linga is of the nature of absorption with highest
reality, which shines in the form, "I am This." Therefore, it is
related to the pure level of dynamic energy on the one hand, and on
:230 NOTES
the other, to the objective world. The manifest (vyakta) linga is of
the nature of cognition in which I-Consciousness becomes subordi-
nated and manifests itself as if distinct from it and therefore shines
as "This." However, even at this level it does not lose its pure
nature of consciousness.
67. The movement of vital energy is of two kinds. The first one is vibra-
tive and natural, while the other is of the nature of activity and is
born of effort. The dynamic movement of the vital energy is ever
associated with a sound which is known as unstruck sound
(anāhata). It goes on sounding automatically in the heart of every
living being. There is none to utter it or to stop it. All the phonemes
abide inseparably in it. Furthermore, yogins experience two dis-:
tinct aspects of nada. The first is ever shining which does not have
any rest. It only rises once and remains shining forever. Another
aspect of nāda is one which rises but which also sets. However, the
subtle nāda where all the phonemes inseparably abide is known as
the unmanifest sound. Two seed mantras (bijas) called srști and
samhāra are its manifested forms. In other words, nāda is cog-
nized by the help of these seed syllables.
68. These are the letters from "ka” varga to the end of "pa" varga. In
this context they are used as mantras.
69. Samaya is known as convention, i.e., a supposed relation between
words and their meanings.
Chapter Six
70. The vital air is 'of the nature of universal vibration' (sāmānyaspan-
dana), which assumes the form of 'individual vibration' (viśeșa
spanda) known as prāņa, apāna, samāna, udāna, and vyāna.
These five prāņas are locations that must be harnessed for the
attainment of supreme reality.
71. The external objects to which one could take recourse for the attain-
ment of the highest reality are: a sacred diagram (mandala), an
altar, vessels, rosary beads, scriptures, the symbolic form of Śiva,
a human skull (tūra), a form made of plaster or a painting, or an
image or statue in the likeness of one's teacher, etc. They may beNOTES 231
employed in any number and exhibit a wide variation in specific
form, provided one recognizes the object's purpose is attaining the
highest reality.
72. The procedure regarding the vital air (prāņa) is discussed first
because in its creative upsurge, consciousness first assumes the
nature of prāņa. For this reason, one desirous of the attainment of
supreme reality first takes recourse in prāņa. Furthermore, all the
'six paths' (sadadhvās) are supposed to abide in prāņa. In the Tan-
trāloka, Abhinavagupta writes: "The former of the sixfold paths,
which again is threefold, is known as the path of time. Clearly this
path is established in the vital energy (prāņa)" (TĀ 6.37).
73. Manifestation or luminous shining forth of entities occurs in a two-
fold way: either by following a sequential order or manifesting
without any sequence. The former shines through the relation of
cause and effect, i.e., the cause shines prior to the effect, which
comes later. When it shines without any sequential order, for exam-
ple, the knowledge arising from the perception of a painting
appears as a unified whole in which priority and posteriority shine
at the same time. The author states elsewhere that the 'mutative
activity' (kalana) is responsible for the manifestation of all six
paths which are distinct from one another, and also for those enti-
ties in their respective forms of limitations. Both sequence and
non-sequence shine in the vital energy, which is one of the activi-
ties of time. As it causes mutations, divisions, and change, it is
known as kāla, which is derived from the verbal root "kal," one of
the meanings of which is to cause change.
74. Consciousness is eternal. It is free from the fetters of space and
time. The Lord, who is in essence light, on account of his free will,
creates the universe composed of sentient subjects and their objects.
This is done by the power of time called Kālī, the dynamic energy
which is the cause that creates change in external and internal enti-
ties. However, it is relevant to note here that consciousness in its
essence is entirely free from change.
75. The power of time, which is inseparably associated with conscious-
ness (samvit), causes everything to manifest externally. The result232 NOTES
of this mutation is that the very consciousness itself assumes the
nature of vital energy, in which all forms begin to shine forth.
However, in this process of externalization, consciousness by its
free will separates the universe from itself. At that time it cognizes,
"I transcend everything." This is the experience characteristic of
the void (śūnya) of consciousness. This void of consciousness
seems to be static. However, dynamism in the form of a slight
vibrating pulsation begins to show itself. When this happens, the
first creative flow begins to proceed outwardly into manifestation.
This flow is not the flow of consciousness but of the vital energy.
76. When the power of activity becomes predominant, the entire cre-
ation shines forth in a twofold way. First is the 'path of time'
(kālādhva), and second is the 'path of space' (deśādhva). The path
of time consists of three forms known as varņa, mantra, and pada.
The path of space has also three divisions, i.e., kalā, tattva, and
bhuvana.
77. Normally the movement of the vital air proceeds from the 'region of
the bulb' located below the generative organ and the anus. However,
no spiritual result can possibly be attained by the normal movement
of the breath. Therefore, the vital breath should be made to flow
from the heart by one's own effort. The saktis named vāmā, jyeșt
hā, and raudri belong to the prabhu śakti and impel the movement
of the breath, either singly or in combination. While the saktis
related to the Lord, one's own power, and the vital energy jointly
all cause the vital breath to move upwards, at different times they
assume the dominant and subordinate roles with respect to one
another. When the vāmāśakti aspect of prabhu becomes predomi-
nant, the person remains inclined toward the world and material
objects; when the jyeṣṭhāśakti aspect of prabhu assumes domi-
nance, it brings about the enlightenment of the aspirant; the raudri
aspect of prabhu keeps a person linked to the world, but at the same
time it helps him to attain identity with Śiva.
78. In the movement of the breath from the heart up to the 'end of
twelve' (dvādaśānta), the vital air occupies the space of thirty-six
digits in length. If the four quarters of the day are supposed to existNOTES 233
:
there, then nine digits is the length of one quarter. One half of a tuți
is the time of the junction (sandhi).
79. The day is the period when the sun shines and the moon, in the form
of apāna, declines. For this reason, the day is conceived to be the
period of the dark fortnight. Similarly, during the night, apāna, in
the form of the moon, arises; therefore, the night is conceived as
the bright fortnight.
80. There are two places of 'repose' (viśrānti), composed of half of a
tuți each. They are in the center of the heart and at the end of the
twelve' (dvādaśānta), free from the changing effects of time. Both
locations are the junctions of prāņa and apāna. The time unit for
each of them is one tuți:
81. Here the concept of day and night is explained in a different way.
The day is the period when manifestation of objects occurs; the
night is that period when blissfulness becomes predominant.
82. 'The passage of a planet from one sign of the zodiac to another'
(samkrānti), occurs in six sections each along the path of the vital
breath. They are: makara, kumbha, mīna, meșa, vrșa, and mit-
huna, while on the other half they are: karka, simha, kānyā, tulā,
vrşcika, and dhanu. Similarly, the sun's progress towards the north
and towards the south, respectively, is also conceived of as occur-
ring in the breath. The period during which the sun moves to the
north is considered to be the bestower of good results in the other
world, while the period during which the sun proceeds towards the
south is considered to be the bestower of good results in this mate-
rial world.
83. The twelve superintending deities, one for each month, are called
rudras and named Dakşa, Canda, Hara, Candi, Pramatha, Bhīma,
Manmatha, Śakuni, Sumati, Nanda, Gopālaka, and Pitāmahā.
84. If the movement of the vital breath covers one digit, only represent-
ing a season (two months), then the sun's movement occupies only
the span of three digits. As a result, the span of one year will be six
digits and in one single movement of the outgoing and ingoing vital
breaths twelve years can be conceived.234 NOTES
85. The normal period of the year with reference to human beings and
the supposed year of the vital breath are different.
86. The span of a divine year is said to to consist of 12,000 human years.
This period is divided into four divisions known as: krta, consisting
4,000 years; tretă, consisting of 3,000 years; dvāpara, consisting
of 2,000 years; and kali, whose duration is 1,000 years. Thus, the
total comes to 10,000 years, while the remaining 2,000 years are
considered to be junctions. The span of these junctions is 400, 300,
200, 100 years and counted in the following way: the last 100 years
of the kali are added to the first 400 years of the krta; thus the span
of the first junction is 500 years. Similarly, the duration of the junc-
ture of the krta and tretā is 400 years plus.300, and thus 700 years;
next, the duration of the juncture of the trētā and dvāpara is 300
years plus 200 and thus 500 years; finally, the juncture of dvāpara
and kali is 200 years plus 100, yielding 300 years. Therefore, the
accumulated duration of all the junctions is 2000 years.
87. Different Indras are said to be the rulers in different cycles of Manu.
During the period in which Brahmā remains active, fourteen cycles
of Manu pass on. This long period is said to be a span of one day of
Brahmā's life. His night is of the same span.
88. The term "three worlds" refers to the nether world along with the
bhuh, bhuvah, and svah.
89. The night in avyakta is said to be a kind of dissolution. However,
this is a subsidiary dissolution (pralaya) and not a principal one
(mahāpralaya).
90. According to the teachings of agamas, those who have attained lib-
eration following the doctrine of Samkhya and other systems are
certain to be created again at the start of new creation. This is
because their liberation is of limited nature and does not elevate
them above māyā. For details see Chapter Eight.
91. The sheaths (kañcukas) are five or six. They are niyati, kalā, rāga,
vidyā, kalā, and māyā. Māyā is the all-pervading principle. The
day of kalā is the duration of 100 years of those who live in the
principle niyati. In the same way, 100 years of kalā is the span of a
day of those who live in the principle rāga. One hundred years ofNOTES 235
principle called rāga are only one day of the principle of vidyā. In
the same way the day of the principle kalā comprises 100 years of
the principle vidyā. Similarly, one day of māyā is made of 100
years of the principle kalā.
92. The night related to the principle of Sadāśiva is considered to be the
great dissolution (mahāpralaya). During this period all the paths
(adhvas) remain dissolved in the state of equilibrium. The super-
intending deity known as Sadāśiva is dissolved in the primal sound
(nāda). This primal sound is in turn dissolved into śakti, śakti into
vyāpinī and vyāpinī into samanā. In samanā there is no trace of
time. It is the eyerlasting state. It is from this state that time arises
like the opening and closing of the eyelids. Though all the limited
souls rest in this supreme state of equilibrium, they do not atfain
final liberation.
93. The creations and dissolutions are highly extensive and varied and
abide in the vital energy. The vital energy is essentially of the
nature of vibrative energy (spanda). This energy, from which time
and its divisions emerge, is ever-pulsating. Time is not at all abso-
lute but relative, and it has its base in the will of the Lord. On
account of the vibration of consciousness, the minute moment
becomes varied and it is experienced as highly extensive.
94. There are two 'ends of twelve' (dvādaśānta). One is above brah-
mārandhra and the other is in mūlādhāra. The first is known as
śivadvādaśānta, the end of twelve related to Śiva, and the other is
known as the end of twelve related to śakti.
95. The six causal deities (kāraṇașatka) each have six centers. They
abide in those centers in the ascending and descending order. The
superintending deities of the respective centers function in differ-
ent stages of life and finally bestow release (mokșa).
96. The ten principal channels that prāņa circulates through are idā,
pingalā, sușumnā, gāndhārī, hastiyjihvā, pūṣā, yaśā, alamhbusā,
kuhū, and śankhinī. Although all the channels have emerged from
the navel, they become manifest in the heart.
97. The superintending deities of directions are ten. They are Indra,
Vahni, Yama, and so on. They rotate in a cyclic order and as a236 NOTES
result, limited souls act in accordance with the nature of these dei-
ties. Sometimes they are morbid, sometimes they are haughty, sad,
elated, happy, unhappy, etc.
98. The names of three principal channels are idā, pingalā, and suş
umna. They are supposed to be located inside the spinal cord. Idā
is placed at the left, pingalā to the right, and sușumnā in the mid-
dle of the spinal cord. Idā represents the moon, pingalā the sun,
and suşumnā the fire. While the vital air samāna moves along
these three principal channels up and down, they assume the
nature of the sun, the moon, and fire.
99. All the Sanskrit syllables are divided into eight groups (varga). All
the vowels come under "a" group (varga). The number of vowels is
sixteen. Then come the group of "ka," "ca," "ta," "ta," "ра,"
"sa," and the group of semi-vowels.
100. The number of half mātrās regarding "ka" and so on is thirty-three.
Half mātrās of long vowels are thirty-two. Phonemes known as
pluta have six half mātrās. Therefore, the total of half mātrās is 81.

101. According to this system, the Lord's power of action (kriyāśakti)
manifests time and space as 'paths' (adhvas). The path of space is a
means of unifying and traversing insubstantial and substantial
forms such as the intellect, the altar or image, the void. Despite
this diversity, all these forms abide in consciousness and have their
place of repose (viśrānti) in consciousness.
102. On the path, all forms shine internally and externally through the
outlets of consciousness; this is how they are created and mani-
fested. Consciousness, in its autonomy, shines as both the knowing
subject and its object. The variety of objects, though not different
from the knowing subject, appears as if different from it.
103. The aspirant attains the nature of Bhairava by perceiving everything,
from the all-consuming fire (kālāgni) said to abide at the bottom of
the earth, to the highest principle, i.e., anāśritaśiva, in ascending
order and unifying them into the singularity of I-Consciousness.NOTES 237
104. Worlds of a variegated nature are included under the principle of
earth. The sphere under which they shine is called the sphere of
Brahmā. Similarly, other spheres, e.g., the sphere of prakrti, the
sphere of māyā, and the sphere of śakti, are wider than the preced-
ing one. All the principles from water to prakrti come under the
sphere of prakrti. All the principles from purușa to māyā come
under the sphere of māyā. The extent of the sphere of sakti extends
up to the Sadāśiva principle. Thus, the number of spheres (andas)
is four. The spheres are the masses of substance which have fallen
from the state of energy.
105. According to this system; there are ten 'guardians of the quarters'
in accordance with the number of. directions. The guardians of
each direction are composed of a group of ten, consisting of a
superintending deity and nine subordinates. Taken as ten groups of
ten guardians, the total number becomes 100 deities; therefore,
they are known as the "Hundred Rudras" (Śatarudras).
106. This system envisions a limitless number of 'worlds' made from
and dominated by each principle. These worlds exist so that souls
which have not received the Saiva form of initiation, but have
attained a lower form of perfection through a continuous practice
of concentration, receive a body and sense organs best suited for
experiencing pleasure and pain in a particular world, and may
finally attain identity with the Lord. Every world has superintend-
ing deities who are called the Lords of that world.
107. Located in the intellect principle (buddhi tattva) are eight 'worlds'
(bhuvana), each dominated by a class of heavenly beings or deity:
piśacas, rakśasas, yakśas, gandharvas, Indra, Soma, Prajāpati,
and Brahmā.
108. According to the Svacchanda Tantra, the names of the worlds
under prakrti are: Akṛta, Krta, Vaibhava, Brahmā, Vaisnava,
Kaumara, 'belonging to Uma' (Auma), and 'belonging to Śrīkant
ha.' Kşemarāja explains that those who have practiced yoga with
renunciation attain the 'world' (bhuvana) named Akrta, while
those who practiced karmayoga reach the bhuvana named Krta.
Similarly, those who practiced nirmanayoga go to the world of238 NOTES
rbhus. The abode of Brahmā is attainable to those who practice
yoga with conviction that puruşa is one universal soul. The abode
of Vişņu is the final resort for those who strictly practiced yoga
according to Vaisnava tradition. Those who practice yoga main-
taining celibacy (brahmacārya) go to the abode of Kaumara world.
The abodes above this, named Auma and Sraikantha, are the
abodes of those who practice yoga according to the Śaiva doctrine.
109. There are seven groups of eight deities who preside over different
principles. The first is called patyșttaka, the group of eight Lords
beginning with Lakulisa and ending with Amaresa. The second is
called Guhyāşțaka who are the Lords of fire; the first of them is
Bhairava. The third group is Atiguhyāșttaka, which rules over the
principle named wind (vayu). The fourth group of eight is called
Pavitrāștaka, with Sthānu, etc., who rule over the principle called
ākāśa. The fifth group of eight, beginning with Sthula and ending
with Chagalāņda, rules over ahaṁkāra. The sixth group of eight
divinities called Yonyaștaka rules over the intellect. The seventh
group of eight is called Yogāștaka which rules over prakrti.
110. The eleven worlds of the Rudras are as follows: Vāma, Bhima,
Ugra, Bhava, Iśa, Ekavīra, Pracanda, Gaurī, Aja, Ananta, and
Ekaśiva.
111. The names of the worlds in impure vidyā, kale, and niyati are Kro-
dheśa and Canda, Samvarta and Jyoti, Sūra and Pancānta, respec-
tively.
112. The worlds under kalā and māyā are as follows: Ekavīra, Śikhi,
Śrīkantha in kalā, while in māyā, Mahātejas, Vāma, Bhava, Udb-
hava, Ekapinga and Īśāna, Bhuvaneśa and Angustha.
113. In pure vidyā principle there are five worlds. They are: Hala-
halarudra, Krodha, Ambika, Aghora, and Yama.
114. Every principle is composed of subtle elements (kalās). They are
called nirrtti, pratiṣṭhā, vidyā, śāntā, and śāntātītā. The number
of worlds in nirrttikalā is sixteen; in pratisthā the number is fifty-
six; in vidyā the number is twenty-eight; in śāntā the number is
eighteen. There are no worlds in śāntātītā. Thus, the total number
of the worlds in all five kalās is one hundred eighteen.NOTES 239

115. The generic attribute of all jars is jarness, i.e., that which perme-
ates all jars. The highest Lord, Śiva, is far more extensive than any
other generic attribute; therefore, he is the greatest universal by
whose light everything shines.
116. According to this system, where some specific characteristics such
as, support, solidity, etc., are found, that is to be known as the
earth principle. These characteristics of the earth are seen in the
regions beginning with the all-consuming dreadful fire (kālāgni)
and ending in the world of Virabhadra.
117. The theory of the nature of absolute causal relation states that even
at the emergence of creation, the universe is nothing but an expan-
sion, an 'opening up' (srști) of the light of the autonomous Lord.
The Lord is also the cause of 'maintenance' (sthiti), i.e., the uni-
verse remaining steadily present within the Self; and 'withdrawal'
(samhāra), the state of rest in one's own Self. According to this
theory, in reality no change has taken place in the Self, which is
identical with consciousness. Furthermore, internality and exter-
nality are not distinct from each other, but two sides of the same
reality. The artificial or fictional causal relation is not real, and is
accepted only to help explain the state existing in māyā. The power
of causal relation is limited and governed by the Lord's restrictive
power (niyati).
118. For the creation of a particular object, some elements are present
in the beginning and others follow it in a regular order. This order
of sequence, in the form of priority and posteriority, remains
invariably present; for example, the clay used in making a jar is
always present before the jar itself comes into existence.
119. Every effect has in its background the sentient cause as its agent. If
the conscious agent is absent, the aggregation of all the causes,
either individually or collectively, cannot produce the intended
object. For example, even if the stick for moving the potter's wheel,
clay, and other necessary materials for making a jar are present,
the jar cannot be produced if the potter himself is absent. There-
fore, it is concluded that a conscious agent is required for produc-240 NOTES
ing an effect. However, all of the above-mentioned instruments,
along with the sentient agent, are considered as the cause of any
action which in reality terminates in consciousness.
120. It is generally accepted that the causal relation depends on or is
controlled by the restrictive power of the Lord. Therefore, it is
relative, but the absolute causal relation depends on none. Con-
sciousness shines in the form of the universe. For instance, all the
principles (tattvas) from earth to Śiva are dependent on the one
prior to it. The earth is supported by the water, the water helps the
earth for its solidity. Furthermore, all the elements are unable to
come into being without the existence of subtle elements. In the
same way, these subtle elements cannot come into existence with-
* out the blossoming action of the sense organs. That again is impos-
sible without determination regarding different sense organs. This
also is not possible without the existence of the primary matter
inseparably and equally linked with all, which is known as
mūlaprakrti. This primary matter, being an enjoyable object, is
unable to exist without the subject that enjoys it. The subject that
experiences it is the sharer of the experience of different objects of
experience. It is for that reason that it is considered limited. Thus,
the limitation that is seen in a conscious subject (puruşa) is only
imposed and not real. This imposed limitation is due to kāla, kalā,
niyati, rāga, and vidyā, which cannot be activated without con-
sciousness (samvit). However, consciousness, being partless, can-
not manifest without the existence of the delusive power called
māyā. Freedom, the cause of limitation, has comparative distinc-
tions of manifestation. These features are shining in the beginning
as slightly unlimited, then unlimited, then slightly blossoming and
finally are fully bloomed. However, these states of the manifesta-
tions by the power of freedom could not be possible without that
which is perfectly luminous by nature, which in this system is
called Bhairava.
121. This remark explains the existence of differentiation or multiplicity
in spite of the presence of the Absolute everywhere.
122. Mount Meru cannot be supposed to be the cause of the jar, becauseNOTES 241
it exists in a distant place. The question implied here is, how could
the universe be created by a Lord who remains distant?
123. This is to say that the effects can be produced in a variety of ways.
124. Śiva is, in essence, consciousness. He is perfectly full and free
from desire. In the state of māyā, the limited soul feels a longing
for an object in order to fulfill his desires. The desire arises in the
limited soul because of some want in him. The Lord, on the other
hand, does not lack anything. Therefore, there is no question of
any desire in him. However, on account of his freedom, a sort of
intention toward tasting of his delight continuously goes on. The
- pentad named śiva, śakti, sadāśiva, īśvara, and śuddhavidyā, who
abide in the pure path (adhva), shine with comparative intensity
from the relish of the taste of delight on account of his autonomy. It
is because of the comparative intensity of this relish that con-
sciousness manifests itself as "I" (aham). This is known as the
state of sakti. In other words, consciousness which is absolute
(anuttara) now sees (as if), on the mirror of consciousness, its own
reflection and cognizes it to be its own, then the cognition that fol-
lows is "I am This" (aham idam). In this instance, the substratum
where it shines is "I" and "This" shines as an indistinct outline of
the picture. In the cognition, "I am This," "I" is the principal and
"This" has the subordinate position. The principle known as
sadāśiva abides where the host of the subjects called mantreśvara
cognizes the universal light of consciousness as “I am This." But
on the level of the knowing subjects called mantreśvara, this cog-
nition assumes the form of "This is I," where "This" is vividly
prominent and "I" is subordinate. This principle is called īśvara,
where "This" as the knowable shines with "I,” invariably one with
it. In śuddhavidyā, on the other hand, there is no distinction
between principality and subordinacy. There both "I" and "This"
shine in a balanced way.
125. In this triadic system, subjects are of seven kinds. They are known
as sakala, pralayākala, vijñānākala, mantra, mantreśvara,
mantramaheśvara, and Śiva. Impurities are of three kinds. They
are āņava, māyīya, and kārma. The āņavamala is of two kinds.
:242 NOTES
First, it lacks right knowledge regarding the Self, which is of the
nature of consciousness. The second is the wrong notion of con-
ceiving non-self, that is, the body, the sense organs, prāņa, etc., as
the Self. The impurity born of māyā (māyīya) causes the notion of
difference. The impurity born of deeds (karma) appears to the soul
to be of the nature of virtue and vice. Impurities are considered to
be the bond by which souls remain bound to worldly existence. The
knowing subjects who have all of the above three defilements
(mala) are called sakala. The souls known as pralayākala have two
such impurities, i.e., āņava and karma. The vijñānākala souls have
only one mala. They are of two kinds: (a) free vijñānākala souls, in
which all-impurities have ended, and (b) vijñānākala souls, in
which some trace of impurity still persists. From among the first
group, eight vidyeśvaras are selected, and from the second group
seven million mantras serve the Lord to help the worldly people.
126. Śiva is always perfectly full of His five powers. However, he mani-
fests different principles in which a particular energy shines pre-
dominantly while other energies remain subordinate. On account
of this factor different principles, even in this pure path, and dis-
tinct features like Śiva, Sadāśiva, etc., become manifest.
127. According to this system, defilement (mala) is not a distinct sub-
stance as accepted by dualist Śaiva thinkers.
128. It is comparable to a seed, which does not take root and blossom
externally and is going to be destroyed.
129. The characteristic of kalā is limited doership.
130. In some doctrines kāla evolves after niyati, but in the present text
niyati is mentioned after kāla. The reason for this is that the causal
relation cannot stand without time, for the regular order of the
cause preceding the effect cannot take place without time. Priority
and posteriority can exist only when time comes into being.
131. Kalā is the agent which creates the knowable object and the effect
as separate from itself.
132. Sukha is the state of agitation which is pleasant, rajas is the state
of agitation which is painful, while tamas is the state of agitation
which lacks awareness.
:NOTES 243
133. Above intellect (buddhi) and below the primordial matter (prakṛti),
a guņa principle (tattva) is supposed to exist. It is only an aspect of
prakrti, the balanced state of three guņas. Therefore, the balanced
state of guņas is called prakrti and its agitated aspect is known as
guņa tattva. However, guņa is not counted as a distinct principle
from prakrti. The impelling force that agitates or breaks the bal-
ance of prakrti is the superintending deity of the tattva. The agita-
tion in prakṛti occurs in relation to those who desire enjoyment,
but in those in whom these desires of enjoyment have disappeared,
this agitation does not create any effect. According to the Trika
system, agitation in prakrti is caused by the Lord Śrīkanthanātha.
134. According to Samkhya philosophy, prakrti is insentient, while.
puruşa is sentient but non-active either in bondage or in liberation.
Therefore, some external agent of agitation is required. According
to Śaiva philosophy, agitation is created by the intervention of
Iśvara.
135. As, for example, when one perceives an object, the cognition "I
see a tree" arises. In this instance, “I” is a subject and a tree is an
object. The relationship between the two, the experiencing subject
and object is the result of ahaṁkāra. For seeing a tree, eyes are
sufficient, but the sight of the tree is experienced by the instru-
ment "I" ahaṁkāra.
136. When, by spiritual practice, the mind becomes subtle, it does not
require any external instrument for perception. At that point, it
can see through the sense of touch and experience touch through
the sense of hearing, etc.
137. This is a reference to the Vaiśeşika school of thought, according to
which sense organs are born of matter.
Chapter Nine
138. Here thirty-six principles (tattvas) are understood in terms of
seven kinds of knowing subjects (pramātā) residing on the seven
spheres along thirty-six principles.
139. The plural ending attached to the names of these seven knowing
subjects indicates the existence of a great number of knowing sub-
jects belonging to each of these groups.
:244 NOTES
140. In the lowest sphere, from earth to prakṛti, reside the sakala know-
ing subjects. The sakala knowing subjects are capable of perceiv-
ing only the principles from earth to prakrti. The higher knowing
subjects, who possess more extensive subjectivity and therefore
possess qualitatively different energies (śaktis), are capable of per-
ceiving the higher principles.
141. In TĀ 10:3-5, Abhinavagupta explains:
The principles from earth to prakrti are divided into
fifteen on the basis of the [seven] possessors of power
(śaktimān), their powers (saktis), along with their 'unique
nature' or 'thing in itself (svarupa). There are thir-
teen divisions from purusa to kală; eleven divisions
[exist] when the pralayakala [group of knowing sub-
jects] becomes the thing in itself; it is similar with māyā;
[there are] nine divisions when the thing in itself becomes
vijnānākala; seven divisions [manifest] when the man-
tra [knowing subjects] becomes the unique nature; a
threefold division [arises] when the mantramaheśvaras
become the unique nature. Śiva, whose nature is con-
sciousness, which is dance of uninterrupted light, has no
division.
142. The expression prameyatāyogya means: 'that which is worthy to
be conceived as an object itself,' that is, as insentient; it is neither
energy nor the possessor of energy.
143. According to this system, the universe is of a threefold nature,
non-transcendent (apara), transcendent-non-transcendent (parā-
para), and transcendent (para). In other words, reality is primarily
conceived as possessing an objective side (nara), energy (śakti),
and a possessor of the energy (śaktimān). However, Abhi-
navagupta points out that the 'thing in itself' (svarupa) is the
sphere of objectivity, the sākta is the sphere of perception, and the
possessor of power is the perceiver or knowing subject. Therefore,
all seven knowing subjects are Śiva, who possesses different ener-
gies, that is, different powers in the different spheres in which they
operate. The thing in itself is common to all of them, which pro-
vides a degree of objectivity.NOTES 245
144. Limited knowledge (vidyā) and limited agency (kalā) are consid-
ered to be the energies of the sakala souls, who are defiled by all
three impurities (malas). Although sakala souls are bound and
limited by impurities, they possess the powers of knowledge and
action.
145. The word asphuța means indistinct or dormant. In pralayākala
souls, vidyā and kalā are still present; however, they remain dor-
mant because they rest in deep sleep (sușupti).
146. The sevenfold differentiation of the saktis is used for the purpose
of elaboration and instruction. In reality, there is only one śakti
belonging to the Lord; that is, His svātantryaśakti, which is
inseparably united with Him. This autonomy manifests itself as
many śaktis, but at the same time keeps all of them within and
shines as one.
147. Distinctions among the instruments do not create distinction in the
subject. The supreme subject, by means of its power of freedom,
creates divisions in its own Self by causing some to shine as an
object, and others as an instrument.
:
148. Here begins a long and complex argument in which Abhinavagupta
attempts to refute 'doctrine of perceptibility' advocated by the
Mīmāṁsā school. According to the Mīmāṁsā theory, in order to
be perceived, every object must possess a quality of perceptibility;
any object devoid of this quality cannot be perceived. Abhi-
navagupta disagrees and attempts to prove that perceptibility is not
the quality of an object, but a power possessed by the perceiver.
All entities already exist within consciousness, and when a given
entity appears within the organs of perception of a perceiver, then
it becomes an object of perception. Everything is illuminated by
consciousness, including defilement (mala), as well as non-exis-
tence, because for a thing to be non-existent, it must be included in
consciousness. Therefore, objective existence depends on con-
sciousness, and is not perceptible independently from it. For Abhi-
navagupta, it is important to establish this position, because he
needs to argue that the knowing subject must develop a higher
level of subjectivity to be able to perceive the larger and subtler
spheres of reality.246 NOTES
149. The one who is self-luminous does not need anyone to perceive this
shining, because it is the very nature of the divine to shine. There-
fore, He does not assume the nature of objectivity, and because of
that the quality of being perceptible, which is distinct from its own
Self, does not appear in Him.
150. The point here is that this feeling of jealousy does not abide in the
beautiful woman, but in the person himself.
151. The act of watching this dance becomes complete when a person
attains the state of aesthetic pleasure by becoming one with the
unified light of awareness manifested through the watching audi-
ence; thus, vidyā and kalā awaken subjectivity in sakala souls
where objectivity is predominant.
152. The point here is that when objectivity in the principles from puruşa
to kalā are conceived and the portions of the veils (kañcukas) come
into perception in the form of objects, then the subjectivity of
puruşa is lost.
153. The distinctions have been ascertained, but the number of objects
which possess multiple natures cannot be stated. Therefore, the
author, taking a clay jar as an example, presents its varied nature.
Its quality of being a knowable object is nothing but its identity
with the knowing subject. Therefore, when the jar is known by all
knowing subjects as a jar, then it comes under the sakala group.
When, on the other hand, it is only perceived by Śiva, it is none
other than Śiva Himself.
154. The seeker who apprehends the earth principle as Brahman, but
who dies before becoming fully established in Śiva, attains the
state of vijñānākala.
155. Those who practice the yoga of conceiving the earth principle as
Brahman, by the end of the day of Brahmā (kalpa), or at the time
of death, attain the state of pralayakevala.
156. When the group of seven knowing subjects, from sakala to Śiva, is
agitated (prakșobha), they become intent on functioning in their
respective fields. This agitation is known as a 'pulsation' or a
'change.' This brings about the appearance of the seven śaktis; there-
fore, the number of possessors of the śaktis (śaktimān) is also seven.
:NOTES 247
157. The purity of pure knowable (suddhaprameya) is a result of it not
being touched by the knowing subject. This is the case with the
earth principle as well as the thing in itself (svarūpas) of all the
other principles as well.
158. When a person well-established in prāņa perceives an external
object, his breath goes outside to a span of sixteen digits (angulas).
When the final measure comes in contact with an object, the
breath becomes identified with it. This is explained by the term
tanmayi.
159. Those who are endowed with discerning capability are able to con-
ceive fifteenfold nature to the end of pradhāna.
160. With the lessening of-the-number.of thought constructs, the span of
a tuți also lessens. The lessening of the thought of this-ness
(idantā) diminishes gradually, and it finally results in the form of
absorption into Śiva constituting two digits (angulas).
161. The word sāvadhānatā here means 'steadiness of consciousness of
that is not to be diverted from here to there, or from this to that.' It
means that the yogin remains attentive towards that one from
which the knower of the object (grāhaka) arises, and from where
the object gets its rise. It always remains steady in self-luminous
consciousness alone.
162. According to early Śaiva thinkers, such as Kallața, the meaning of
the word pāta is goddess Kālī, Mātṛsadbhāva, Bhairava, Pratibhā.
However, the author himself is reluctant to go into depth explain-
ing the mystical meaning of this word.
163. When a yogin practices meditation in the tuți related either to
mantramaheśvara, mantreśvara, or mantra, he is able to attain
the siddhis corresponding to these states.
164. The dream state is considered to be an instrument, or rather, a
door, by the help of which one is able to arrive at the right form of
knowledge.
165. The supreme consciousness externally assumes threefold nature.
These are the object of knowledge (rūpam), the instrumentality
indicated in the sentence above by the expression "by means of
sight," while the word aham indicates the subject of experience.248 NOTES
Therefore, the subject knows the object by means of the instru-
ment, i.e., sight. However, the supreme subject (parā) permeates
and remains above these three.
Chapter Ten
166. According to this system, there exists a subtle energy which func-
tions to hold all the principles (tattvas) in their respective places.
For example, the principle earth is held by the subtle energy called
dhārikā. As the function of this energy is to contain or stop the
earth, it is also called nivṛtti. Similarly, the subtle energies called
pratisthā, vidyā, and śāntā are active in other principles or in
groups of them.
*167. Anda sphere, or egg, is that which serves as the wall separating
one sphere from the other. They are also called coverings or veils
(āvaraņa) which do not allow one sphere to penetrate another.
168. This is to say that the qualities, such as smell, taste, touch, etc.,
belonging to earth and other tattvas exist also in the sakti tattva;
however, their existence is not in the gross form but in the subtle.
This is the reason why Śiva is ritually worshipped in the phallic
form made of five different elements.
169. The principle called Śiva is free from any sorts of mutations, limi-
tations, or thought constructs.
170. This is to say that transcendence cannot be an object of meditation.
If an object of meditation were to exist in it, it would not be tran-
scendent. Therefore, the kalā that functions in the lower level, just
below the highest, is known as śāntā. However, Śiva is beyond
śāntā; therefore, no name is suitable to describe the Immutable One.
171. Anything that shines as knowable remains existing for some time,
but when the quality of being an object of knowledge disappears
from the heart of the yogin, that which remains is known as thirty-
six principles. Even if, for the purpose of teaching, in that state,
the divine is conceived as the thirty-seventh principle, then upon
the disappearance of even this objectivity from it, the divine is
conceived as the thirty-eighth principle.NOTES 249
172. When the whole scheme of thirty-six tattvas is grouped into nine
divisions, then their names are prakṛti, puruşa, niyati, kāla, māyā,
vidyā, īśvara, sadāśiva, and Śiva.
173. The worlds are perceived as objects of knowledge shining in three
different forms of knowable objects. They are: kalā, tattva, and
bhuvana. In the same way, when they rest in the subject, they are
also threefold, i.e., varņa, mantra, and pada.
Chapter Eleven
174. Abhinavagupta's thesis is, in essence, that consciousness (samvid)
is a perfect unity, full and unchanging even when taking the forms
of all manifestations and activities. What is contained in the first
ten chapters of this work constitutes a short-cut for a small number
of truth-seekers who, according to this system, have been pursuing
spiritual perfection over many lifetimes. The significance of this
knowledge for others is made clear in this chapter.
175. It is stated in the Bhagavadgīta that the fire of knowledge burns
the karma of all deeds. For one undergoing the experience of past
deeds, it is necessary to remain involved in actions whose fruits
are to be experienced in the future. The doer has to experience the
results of past actions gradually, not all at once. There is no end to
the cycle of deeds or their results, and for this reason the descent
of grace (saktipāta) needs to be discussed. According to the posi-
tion represented here, when Śakti 'opens up' in one's own self,
right knowledge dawns spontaneously.
176. Karmasāmya occurs as a result of balance of two mutually oppo-
site past actions. Both of these actions possess exactly equal power,
and therefore restrict each other from producing any fruit. Accord-
ing to this theory, śaktipāta takes place when these two deeds are
balanced and their results neutralized.
177. According to the teacher Khețapāla, that sakti whose nature is to
restrain (nirodhikā) arrests the mala. When impurities (mala)
become perfectly ripened, the above sakti becomes inactive, and
the proper manifestation of knowledge and action occurs. This cul-
minates in the decent of grace (śaktipāta) on a seeker.250 NOTES
178. When the Lord assumes the form of bound being by accepting the
limitations of time, space, etc., this does not entail any differentia-
tion in His innermost nature.
179. The term jhatiti means 'without delay,' that is, taking recourse
directly to anupāya.
180. The term 'by gradual process' (krameņa) refers to a method of ini-
tiation, performance rituals, etc.
181. This is the Śaiva explanation of the nature of the descent of grace.
In the process of manifestation, the supreme Lord (Parameśvara)
creates limited beings by concealing (tirobhāva) His own Self
through kancukas, tattvas, and the malas. He reveals his own Self
by bestowing śaktipāta on-limited souls. The entire process of con-
cealment and revelation is the result of the autonomy (svātantrya)
of the Lord.
182. This is to say that the autonomous and omnipresent Lord is impar-
tial and therefore there is no object, activity, or person that He
prefers over others.
183. As it is stated, the right kind of teacher (guru) is considered to be
equal to Bhairava. This is because he possesses the fullness of self-
realization as well as the right understanding of the meaning of the
śāstras.
184. Although śakti is present everywhere, it has different forms with
different effects: as jyeșthā-śakti, it leads one to the ultimate goal;
on the other hand, the ghorā and ghoratarā-śaktis, that is, the
fearsome and the terrible, lead one toward worldly existence.

185. Vīras are Śaiva practitioners deemed to have attained mastery over
the senses and a high level of spiritual development.
186. The procedure of external bathing is as follows: keeping the mind
steadily concentrated on the mantra given to him by the guru, one
should follow the track of the cows while dust is still present in the
air. One is supposed to enter, and should make three strides in the
dust created by the cows. This is known as pārthiva bath. In theNOTES 251
same way, one should purify the whole body, beginning with head
and ending with feet, by uttering the mantra of Śiva with its five
limbs (Isana is the head, Tatpuruşa is the face, Aghora is the heart,
Vamadeva is the hidden parts of the body, and Sadyojāta is the
whole body). Then, having cleansed the body with the mantra, one
should plunge into the water repeating the mantra of Śiva with its
auxiliary parts. This is known as bathing with water. Taking ashes
from the sacrificial fire, one should burn impurities present on the
head, face, heart, genitals, and the feet with it while uttering the
mantra "phat." When this is done one should throw a handful of
these ashes on the head while repeating the mantra of Śiva with its
five limbs. This is known as bathing with ashes. One should move
back and forth in the pleasing air, remembering the mantra, given
to him by his guru, in his heart. This is known as bathing with air.
One should bring the mantra into one's mind and should remain
concentrated there fixing his concentration on the void (ākāśa).
This is known as bathing in the void. One who immerses oneself in
the light of the sun and the moon, identifying himself with Śiva, is
cleansed of all impurities. This type of bathing is called soma and
arka. The last type of bath is bathing in the Self (ātmā). In the Tan-
trāloka, Abhinavagupta describes it in the following way: "The
very Self is the supreme Lord himself; it is free from disciplines
established in spiritual texts. It is like a great lake in extension and
depth; the universe should dissolve therein, upon which one
becomes pure and the cause of purification for others."
187. The expression "tatratatra" refers to the five faces of Śiva, i.e.,
Īśana, Tatpuruşa, etc. One is to first identify with these five faces
of Śiva, upon which one attains full absorption into Śiva.
Chapter Thirteen
188. The author begins this chapter, which deals with initiation, by
describing the procedure for selecting a suitable place for worship,
mantra repetition, and practice of yoga. He discusses this topic in
Chapter 15 of his TĀ, verses 80-115ab. At the very beginning,
Abhinavagupta points out that only when one is serene and well-252 NOTES
disposed in his heart (bhāvam prasannam alocya) is he suitable to
perform worship, and only then should he proceed to the place of
worship.
189. In TĀ 15: 114a-115b, Abhinavagupta describes the place where
the worship should take place: "The suitable place for either
attaining perfection or liberation with regard to the practice of
worship, mantra repetition, or attainment of samādhi-is the one
where heart is inclined toward beauty and at peace."
190. The land of Aryans is between Himālaya and Vindhyācala.
191. Kāraka is a term, used by Pāņini in his Aşțādhyāyī, which denotes
various participants in action presented by a sentence. The closest
equivalent in other classical and some modern languages is a word
'case,' such as nominative, genitive, accusative, ablative, etc.
192. Abhinavagupta, who advocates the theory of the supreme nondual-
ity, has to account for ritual action, which consists of factors or
participants in action presented by a sentence (kārakas), which
because of their perceived distinction could be construed as con-
tradicting nonduality. This was certainly the opinion of Śamkarā-
cārya and other Advaita Vedānta thinkers; Abhinavagupta dis-
agreed with this understanding and argues that action, distinction,
change, etc., are also included within consciousness. To illustrate,
we can take the example of the following sentence: I offer water
from the sacrificial pot to Lord Śiva with a spoon in the place of
worship. The factors here are: the agent of acting, the object of the
act, its instrument, its point of ablation, and the location of the act
of worship. For Śamkarācārya, the supreme reality cannot be of
the same order as that of objective existence which is transient in
nature. The Brahman is the transcendent, immutable, and partless
reality, and all subjective and objective phenomena are only
appearances possessing no real existence. The Brahman is without
attributes and as immutable, it cannot be subject to action. The
attribute of changeability is the most important characteristic of
objective existence, and therefore ever-changing empirical exis-
tence must have a ground on which all these changes take place.
The same, of course, applies to the ritual action, which, as we haveNOTES 253
seen, consists of the factors or the participants in action described
by a sentence. For Abhinavagupta, on the other hand, the supreme
reality, which consists of prakāśa and vimarśa, even in the process
of externalization, remains established in its own Self, 'relishing'
(camatkāra) the bliss of 'fullness' (pūrṇatā), and 'independence'
(svatantrya) of its own essential nature, which is in no way over-
shadowed by the external manifestation. The lower aspect of cre-
ation is a contracted form of that supreme consciousness, which,
through the activity of māyā śakti, assumes limited forms, thus
bringing into existence the notion of duality. Thus, the supreme
reality consists as much of differentiation as it does of unity. This
differentiation always remains within that I-Consciousness and
therefore is never separate from it. Thus, unlike Śamkara for
whom action is always binding, Abhinavagupta accepts action,
such as the ritual activity, as potentially liberating.
193. In TĀ 15: 161, Abhinavagupta describes the role and the meaning
of sacrificial vessel in Tantric ritual in the following way: "All that
which is touched by the drops of the water contained in the sacrifi-
cial vessel becomes in fact pure. What other kind of purity could
there ever be but that of the touch of the rays of the sun of Śiva?"
Furthermore, "As the Lord said in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra in
the section dealing with the sacrificial vessel, it is necessary to be
careful not to conceive anything as not being purified by it. Every-
thing is purified by it and what is impure becomes pure" (TĀ 15:
162-163ab.) However, the impurity only belongs to the limited
knowing subject abiding in māyā and is not the essential nature of
things: "Here we speak of impurity from the perspective of bonded
souls and of their systems. The essential nature of all things
remains in fact always the same, without changing from what it
was earlier or what is conceived to be" (TĀ 15: 163cd-164ab.)
194. All the various factors which constitute a ritual action attain iden-
tity with Śiva through the process of the placement of the syllables
(nyāsa).
195. This is to say that direction depends on how the forms are arranged
in space.254 NOTES
196. Here begins description of inner worship. In the course of this
worship, one is expected to bring one's body, mind, void, and
prāņa into identity with Śiva. See TĀ 15: 295b-312.
197. This is the reference to mūlādhāracakra, which, according to TĀ
15: 297cd, is located four fingers below the navel.
198. Here begins what Abhinavagupta calls 'the external sacrifice'
because the disciple, after attaining identity with Śiva through var-
ious ritual acts, should project his consciousness externally in the
vital breath, void, and up to the external plane.
199. There are eight purificatory rites and six deities. Therefore, the
number becomes forty-eight.
200. For greater details in regard to the conventional rules and their
detailed description, see TĀ 15: 521-611.

Chapter Fourteen
202. Putraka or spiritual son is a type of initiation in which a disciple is
adopted as a successor of a teacher.
203. Parivāra or family refers to the group of subordinate deities cen-
tered around the main deity.
204. This refers to the doors of the place where the rituals are per-
formed.
205. For more details regarding the procedure of 'The Adoration of the
Door' (dvārārcanam) see TĀ 15:184-190.
206. Abhinavagupta talks at length about the nature of animal sacrifice
in TĀ 16:28-72. There, by quoting various scriptures, he points
out that any type of animal killing, such as for profit, a wedding,
or sport, is not allowed except in the course of sacrifice (yāga).
According to him, killing consists of separating an animal that still
possesses each of the three impurities (malas) from the vital
breath. On the other hand, the ritualistic sacrifice of an animal is
not killing because, in the course of the ritual, the animal is first
separated from three impurities, and thus it is separated from its
body. Thus, for Abhinavagupta, ritual sacrifice of an animal is a:
NOTES 255
form of initiation which joins the animal with the higher principles
and for the purpose of propitiating God.
207. The nirbīja type of initiation is given to those judged incapable of
following the set of rules of post-initiatory conduct (samayapāśa),
as for example children, those who are dull, old people, women,
those attached to their wealth, the sick, and so on. They attain lib-
eration on account of their devotion to the teacher, deities, and
scriptures. On the other hand, the sabīja type of initiation is given
to those who have the gift of reason, are capable of tolerating toils
and difficulties, and are therefore capable of following the set of
rules of pre-initiatory conduct.
:
Chapter Fifteen
208. The initiation described in this chapter is given to a dying person.
Ordinarily, the initiation is not given to all, and one desirous of
initiation needs to show his devotion to teacher, deities, or scrip-
tures. This devotion is, in turn, seen as an indication of the descent
of grace (śaktipāta), and śaktipāta is perceived as a definite sign
that one is suitable for initiation. The conditions under which the
teacher is expected to grant initiation to a dying person are
described by Abhinavagupta in the TĀ 19: 4-6: When in a dying
person, the fall of even weak power is awakened-whether he is
taken by devotion to a teacher and others; whether the fall of grace
is through work of friends, relatives, etc.; whether he has been
indeed regular (samayin) but has not obtained the supreme initia-
tion; whether, already having obtained it, he desires to leave as
soon as possible his vital breaths, desirous of going away-the
teacher should provide for him the initiation of immediate depar-
ture, free from impurities. However, the teacher must be careful
not to give initiation to a person whose impurities (malas) haven't
reach maturation, or to one whose karma hasn't been exhausted
(śeṣakārmikavigrahe). The commentator explains this compound
to mean: one who is not about to die, that is, one whose prārab-
dhakarma hasn't been fully exhausted.
209. Marma is the place where the feeling of the connectedness with
the body remains present.256 NOTES
210. According to the Tantrāloka, this is done by means of the nyāsa,
using the kșurikā and other mantras.
211. That is, at the time of leaving one's body.
212. Abhinavagupta describes the nature of brahmavidyā initiation and
the qualifications a teacher needs to have to perform this kind of
initiation in the following way: "This initiation, which provides
exit from the body, must be performed by a teacher who is experi-
enced in yoga. How could one who has not practiced various
prāņayāma exercises be in a position to affect it" (TA19:23cd-
24ab). (The brahmavidyā) is in a position of producing its effects
automatically, such as the purification of the principles, etc. The
teacher, thanks to the power of ritual action and mantras, can thus
join the disciple with the supreme principle (tattva). Even if a
teacher hasn't practiced yoga, he is nevertheless in a position to
execute the initiation that provides immediate exit from the body,
thanks to the power of ritual action, mantras, and meditation.
213. According to Abhinavagupta, both the samayin and purtka are
entitled to recite brahmavidyā. By this recitation, the dying person
receives the samaya type of initiation. See TĀ 19:31.
214. The meaning of the expression sapratyaya is 'with signs or with
giving signs,' as, for example, a person's dead body is re-animated
by the power of mantra and lifts itself, etc.
215. This is the type of initiation which, according to TĀ, gives hope to
foolish individuals. It is described by Abhinavagupta in TĀ 20:2-7:
The teacher, completely intent upon reciting appropriate mantras,
must meditate on his right hand in the form of a triangle of fire,
completely flaming, resplendent with the phoneme of fire, stirred
by a wheel of winds, and must place there any seed and meditate on
how it is burning, both in the hand and within his heart. In this way
the seed, consumed by the heat of a multitude of "phat" mantras
enlivened by the phonemes of fire "ra," loses every seminal quality
and is now incapable of germinating. At the same time, by virtue of
this same procedure, based on the power of mantras, meditation,
and rituals, the three malas (āņava, māyīya, and kārma) are also
'burned' in the sense that they are no longer in a position to furnishNOTES 257
their products. This initiation, which has as its purpose the destruc-
tion of the seed, was described to me by the venerable Śambhunātha
in his benevolence. The teacher, out of mercy, can also join the seed
to Śiva. The initiation is, in fact, full of splendor (sudipta), and is in
a position to grant liberation also to vegetable life.
216. This particular type of initiation, which reduces or eliminates the
weight of a disciple, Abhinavagupta connects with the five stages of
repose, that is, pragānanda, udbhava, kampa, nidrā, and ghūrņi
described in Chapter Five of Tantrasāra. In TĀ 20: 14-15ab, he
clarifies: "The leap (udbhava) is due to relief, caused by an eclips-
ing of the corporeal influence (dehagraha). The body is essentially
constituted by the elements of earth. When the teacher, thanks to
the mantra of lightness, which will be explained later, meditates on
the disciple rising into the air, he loses his earthly qualities."
Chapter Sixteen
217. As we have seen earlier, it is the aspirant's devotion to the teacher,
deity, or śāstras which would entitle him to receive initiation, as
this devotion is perceived as a clear sign of saktipāta. However, in
the case of the deceased or the absent one, this is obviously impos-
sible. Yet, the teacher would perform such an initiation if he could
in some way infer that śaktipāta had descended on such a person.
The signs of this type of saktipāta are, for example: strong feelings
that a teacher himself, for some unknown reason, had for a
deceased or absent soul, or the strong persistence of the family
that advocated initiation.
218. Abhinavagupta describes a procedure called 'application of the
great net' (mahājjāla prayoga) in some detail in TĀ 21: 25-45.
However, the intricacies of this procedure remain unknown because
the ācārya would receive oral instruction from his own teacher.
The purpose of this procedure was rescuing departed souls who, for
one reason or another, did not received initiation during their lives.
A teacher would first catch the desired soul, draw him into the net,
then reinstate him into a figure made of kuśa grass, which repre-
sented his body, and then grant him liberation through initiation.258 NOTES
Chapter Seventeen
219. We have already seen that a disciple is joined to a different princi-
ple in the course of initiation. To which principle one is joined will
depend on the school of thought whose initiation one receives.
However, according to the Trika school, other schools of thought
do not possess the knowledge to enable a disciple to attain identity
with Śiva. Therefore, those who have received initiation into what
the followers of Trika consider inferior sects should be first dis-
joined or drawn away from the principles that they were joined to
by the previous initiation, and then initiated again. The process of
transcending the inferior doctrines is accomplished gradually
through a succession of steps: the descent of grace, the removal of
impurities, the desire to find the right teacher, initiation, knowl-
edge, the abandonment of that which is to be avoided, immersion
into that which is to be accepted, giving up the sphere of the enjoy-
able, and the removal of the limitations created by āņavamala. For
details, see Chapter 22 of the Tantraloka.
:
220. Abhinavagupta gives the names of the genetic mantras
(sādhāraṇāḥ mantrāh) in TĀ 22: 20. They are seven in number
and their names are: praņava or mantra aum, mātṛkā, māyā, vyo-
mavyāpi, şadakşara, bahurupa, and the eye mantra (netra).
According to TĀ 22: 15-17a, this is what a teacher says to one who
is about to embrace Śaivism and receive initiation: "This one was
once a follower of other disciplines but is now inspired by your
blessing; therefore bestow your grace (śaktipāta) upon him, so that
this abandonment of other doctrines does not become a source of
doubt for him, which will oblige him to practice rights of atone-
ment. And having attained identity with you, may he quickly
achieve perfection and liberation."
Chapter Eighteen
221. In TĀ23:3-4, Abhinavagupta explains that a spiritual guide
should transmit his own power (svādhikāra) to a disciple whom he
thinks is at the point of being in possession of well-practiced
knowledge. "The one," continues Abhinavagupta, quoting Kami-
kāgama, "who does not possess this knowledge is not a teacher,NOTES 259
even if he has been anointed and has passed through the various
stages, such as samayin, etc." Furthermore, the only criterion for
the selection of a new teacher is knowledge. Abhinavagupta writes,
"The teacher who creates a new teacher must therefore select an
individual of full and perfect knowledge, without considering any
other characteristic, such as place, family, conduct, and body." ТА
23:16b-17a.
222. In TĀ 23: 31-32, Abhinavagupta describes the responsibilities of a
newly consecrated teacher in the immediate period after his initia-
tion. He writes: "The new teacher, after having obtained consecra-
tion, must meditate and recite the entire complex of mantras estab-
lished in the scriptures for a period of six months so that he
becomes one with them. Having attained identity with the mantras,
and having taken possession of the potency of mantra (mantra-
vīrya), he finally becomes able to cut the bonds. Therefore, he
should spare no effort to attain identity with the mantras."
223. In the Tantrāloka; Abhinavagupta explains that Brāhmaņs, Kșatri-
yas, Vaiśyas, eunuchs, women, Sudras, and any other kinds of per-
son desirous of initiation should be initiated without being asked
their caste. However, the teacher should take this into consider-
ation at the time when knowledge is imparted to them. Further-
more, the teacher, who is the basis of knowledge, should set seven
sessions. These sessions are: initiation, explanation, compassion,
friendliness, contemplation of the śāstras, unification with Śiva,
and giving away of food, etc. See TĀ 23: 20b/23a.
Chapter Nineteen
224. As for the purpose of this rite, Abhinavagupta writes: "This type
of initiation affects the purification of the subtle body (puryașt
aka). If the puryaștaka does not exist, then there is also no heaven
or hell." TĀ 24:20-21.
225. The point here is that the entire procedure performed by teacher
that will be described in the following lines is performed to estab-
lish firm conviction on the side of the ignorant ones. The entire
performance by the teacher, according to Abhinavagupta, is not
helpful in any way in attaining liberation. See TĀ 24:15b-16a.260 NOTES
226. Here begins description of śrāddhadīksā, or post-mortem initiation.
Abhinavagupta discusses it in Chapter 25 of his TĀ based on the
authority of the Siddhayogeśvarimata Tantra. This rite must be per-
formed on the third, fourth, and tenth day after death, every month
in the first year. After that, it should be performed once every year.
227. In TĀ 25: 4-6, Abhinavagupta clarifies: "This done, the teacher
must take in hand, first of all, the offering (naivedyam), and after
having meditated that in this offering abides sakti of the nature of
food in the form of potency instrumental in nourishing, he must
conceive that the dead person for whose sake this rite is performed
is penetrated by it. The bound part in the form of enjoyable of this
dead disciple must then be offered by a teacher to the enjoying sub-
ject in identity with him. In this way, the disciple becomes Śiva.".
Chapter Twenty
228. This vague statement can only be understood if we read it along
with its corresponding section of the TÃ, which is Chapter 26. In
the beginning of this chapter, Abhinavagupta explains that all the
types of initiation presented up to now, including the last sacra-
ment, have as their goals purification, enjoyment, liberation, or
both enjoyment and liberation. Jayaratha, in his commentary, clar-
ifies that the initiation which has enjoyment (bubhuksuh) as its aim
is structured so that it is not in a position to directly grant libera-
tion without first granting the fruition (of the desired enjoyments).
On the other hand, the mumukșuh type of initiation, such as that of
a spiritual son, etc., grants liberation precisely because it is devoid
of the necessity of prior fruition. Furthermore, this type of initia-
tion can be either the sabīja or the nirbīja type. Only those who
received the sabīja type of initiation are expected to follow a cer-
tain set of rules for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, those
deemed incapable of following these rules receive the nirbīja type
of initiation, which in itself includes mantras capable of purifying
the bonds of post-initiatory rules (samayapāśa).
229. Mantras should be received in the course of ritual and should be
kept secret. The practitioner should attain identity with the
potency of the mantra (mantravīrya), without which mantras
:NOTES 261
remain ineffective. Furthermore, mantras should be received
directly from a teacher who has himself attained identity with the
potency of the mantra, and not from some book. In TĀ26:
20-24ab, Abhinavagupta writes:
"The fundamental rule is the following: namely, the man-
tric form is not to be revealed by the teacher to the dis-
ciple in written form, especially in our system, which
is superior to all. The mantras are of the nature of pho-
nemes, and phonemes are of the nature of reflective con-
sciousness. They can be transmitted to the disciple only if
it is not separated from the consciousness of the teacher.
Written mantras are, on the other hand, stripped of their
potency and therefore unreal. Because of the conven-
tional meaning which clouds them, their natural splendor
doesn't manifest from books."
However, it has been stated in the Siddhayogeśvarīmata
that those who, in spite of adopting mantras from books,
attain identity with its potency, are purified by Bhairava
and spontaneously initiated. "Once mantras have been
invoked," continues Abhinavagupta, "it is necessary to
satisfy them and propitiate them with flowers, liquor,
offerings of food and incense, proportionately to the
fate, devotion, and capabilities of the worshipper. The
śakti, nāda, and other mantras, which are especially fer-
vent, must be satisfied with liquor, meat, and blood at
the beginning, and only afterwards with flowers, incense,
etc." (TĀ 26:51b-53a.)
230. The unmanifest or avyaktalinga is one that has been spontaneously
formed in nature. Among all the types of unmanifest lingas, those
not made by human hand are considered to be the most excellent
ones. Therefore, these types of lingas are highly recommended for
the purpose of ritual worship. However, manifest, or vyakta lingas,
can also be used in rituals, Abhinavagupta writes: "The teacher
can, if he wishes, install a manifest linga (vyakta) in the form of an
image or painting found in a picturę or book, made of wood, gold,
or crafted by an expert and initiated artist" (TĀ 27:19b-20a).262 NOTES
Lingas can be made of various materials, such as "little stones,
gems, pearls, flowers, food, clothes, and perfumed substances.
Lingas of stone created by artists, and so also those of metals, with
the exception of gold ones, should be avoided" (TĀ 27: 12-13).
Abhinavagupta points out that various measures, given in various
texts, regarding the size and shape of lingas, and other concerns,
are of little importance because: "The linga which grants the
desired fruit is in fact only the one that has been illuminated by
mantra, animated by its noble potency" (TĀ 27: 14b).
231. With the previous section, the instructions for the types of rituals
that are indispensable observances (nitya) has been completed. In
this section, the description of occasional observances (naimittika)
begins. Abhinavagupta derives the word 'parva' from two roots:
the first root, 'pr,' which means 'to fill,' is combined with the suf-
fix 'van.' The other root is 'parv,' which also means 'to fill'; thus a
celebration of a festival day is called 'parvadinam, because on
that day consciousness attains fulfillment.
:
232. According to the Siddhayogeśvarimata, the other name for the
sacrifice of the wheel (cakrayāga) is mūrtiyāga. The cakrayāga or
mūrtiyāga is of five types. Abhinavagupta writes:
The sacrifice of the wheel is of five types, namely: soli-
tary (kevala), coupled (yāmala), mixed (miśra), cou-
pling of the wheel (cakrayuk), and mingling of heroes
(vīrasamkara). The solitary, in this context, is one in
which only the teacher take part; the mixed is one in
which disciples also take part, along with their wives;
the coupled is of two kinds, based on whether the women
who participated were wives or hired courtesans; the cou-
pling of the wheel is so-called because this is the type of
sacrifice associated with the wheel, which because of the
unification of śaktis grants all desired fruits; finally the
sacrifice in which everybody participates is called min-
gling of the heroes. (TĀ 28: 78b-82a.)
233. One is supposed to perform the offering of the sacred thread (pavi-
traka) to make up for any deficiency and neglect of his responsibil-NOTES 263
ity regarding the teacher, scriptures, or for any transgression of the
rules (samaya), or for those who failed to celebrate a festival day
(parvadinam) or any of the occasional or indispensable observances.
234. Abhinavagupta outlines the procedure applied when a teacher
explains the meaning of scriptures to disciples according to Chap-
ter 52 of the Devyāyamala Tantra.
235. Abhinavagupta lists ten types of teachers capable of explaining the
scriptures: "Each of these ten types of teachers has assumed a
human body and possesses a particular mental disposition, but are
all identical with Śiva, although they are different from each other
through knowledge and action. They are all dedicated to the scrip-
tures, to worship, to-the initiation rites, to sexual union, meat, and
liquor. There are secondary divisions among these due to possess-
ing different mental dispositions, such as tranquility (calmness),
anger, or patience, etc." (TĀ 28: 391a-393.)
236. As we have seen, the spiritual teacher is worshipped in most of the
other sacrifices, but in all of these instances this worship is an
accessory part of the sacrifice. On the other hand, this ritual is
primarily devoted to satisfying or pleasing the teacher.
Chapter Twenty-One
237. In this chapter, Abhinavagupta gives a brief outline of his under-
standing of the nature, meaning, and purpose of the āgamas or
śāstras. This summary is brief and cryptic, and therefore difficult

ters of the Tantrāloka, Iśvarapratyabhijñāvimarsini, or Īśvara-
pratyabhijñāvivṛtivimarśinī.
238. The entire universe is the expression of consciousness, which con-
sists of prakāśa or manifestation, and vimarśa, which is the
knowledge of prakāśa in its collective and particular aspects. In a
narrower sense, this vimarśa is language, which takes the form of
the various āgamas.
239. In the last three chapters of his TĀ, Abhinavagupta discusses the
nature of the śāstras or āgamas at length. The title of Chapter 35 is264 NOTES
'The Union of all the Śāstras.' In it, Abhinavagupta presents his
vision that brings together the great variety of āgamic texts, both
Hindu and non-Hindu. In his analysis, he grants all of them the
status of being authoritative or being a valid means of gaining
knowledge (pramāņa). However, he arranges them in a hierarchi-
cal order, placing the Trika śāstras at the apex.
240. For Abhinavagupta, there is only one āgama from which all the
others emerge. This broad acceptance of all śāstras requires him
to attempt a reconciliation of their differences. In order to accom-
plish this, he points out that all of them bring about the promised
fruit. In this way, Sāṁkhya gives to its follower the knowledge to
discriminate between puruşa and prakrti. Similarly, the follower
of Buddhism attains the buddhi tattva, but only the Trika grants
full and complete liberation to those who are entitled (adhikāri).
For Abhinavagupta, an adhikāri is one who possesses firm faith in
a given āgama. Another question that arises here is: if it is true
that all agamas emerge from one and the same source, then why is
it necessary to perform a ritual of conversion, such as 'reclamation
of linga' (lingouddhāra)? Abhinavagupta explains:
In the body of one single doctrine, as for example, in the
Vedas, it happens that its followers, in order to attain to
superior degrees or ranks, must submit to special rites
of purification. The same thing can be said in regard to
our tradition, as for example, in the case of the reclama-
tion of the linga, etc. In other words, in the way in which
one belonging to a lower āśrama cannot enjoy the fruits
which come from the upper āśrama, in the same way, a
follower of the Pāñcarātras, etc., cannot attain the iden-
tity with Śiva. (TĀ 35:28-29.)
241. In TĀ 35: 1b-2a, Abhinavagupta defines prasiddhi as a type of
knowledge that is necessarily based in an omniscient knowing sub-
ject and is the basis of all human activity.Bibliography

Commentary on the lihagavad Gita
Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the
Bhagavad Gita
(Gitartha-samgraha)
US Edition
Translated with notes by Boris Marjanovic
Abhinavagupta lived in Kashmir in northern
India at the end of the 10th century and begin-
ning of the 11th century. He was a brilliant
scholar and is considered the greatest genius
of India in the fields of philosophy, aesthetics,
poetics and dramaturgy. He was also a profoundly accomplished
Tantric practitioner and the most influential teacher of what is now
called Kashmir Shaivism. Although he was a prolific writer, to date
few of his surviving works have been made available in English.
In this commentary, Abhinavagupta explains that he composed it
because he felt that his predecessors had not understood the eso-
teric or secret meaning of the Bhagavad Gita. In contrast, Abhina-
vagupta's work explores the very essence of the teaching of the
Gita. This unique interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita in the con-
text of the non-dualistic philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism reveals a
new dimension of the message of the Gita and describes the prac-
tice of the secret yoga at its core.

Kashmir Saivism:
The Central Philosophy of Tantrism
By Kamalakar Mishra
Although the contribution of Tantra to Indian
philosophy and culture is of immense signifi-
cance, very little work has been done in the
field to date. Kashmir Saivism: The Central
Philosophy of Tantrism gives a full exposi-
tion of the Tantric system, clarifying the
inner thread of logic running through the entire system of thought.
The enigmatic language of the Tantric texts and their rich symbol-
ism are deciphered, revealing a philosophy that is not an abstract
ideology but a practical approach to life, surprising relevant to this
age of science and technology.
This book explores the principles, rich language and symbolism of
the Tantric tradition, one that integrates worldly involvement with
the goal of liberation. The text uses Abhinavagupta's most famous
work, the Tantrāloka, as a point of departure for a full exposition
of the Tantric system. Kashmir Saivism demonstrates that this
unique philosophy remains practical and relevant.
